## Software

### Releases

* A new version (`1.6.2`) of `xxx` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/xx). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/xx/releases/tag/v1.6.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][xxx].

<br><br>

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

There haven't been any submissions or approved packages since last news - so please do submit your packages!  At least ask questions if you're not sure how it works, or if your package is a good fit.
