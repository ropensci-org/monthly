## Software

* We have started to dive into neuroscience. We recently chatted with three neuroinformaticians about open data and R in their field. They directed us towards lots of interesting sources of open data. Our first shot at this field is the [rif package](https://github.com/ropensci/rif) - an R client to search and get data from the [Neuroscience Information Framework](http://neuinfo.org/) web services. 
* Our R client for [Orcid.org](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid) got a reboot and some new functionality. Give it a try and let us know what you think. [Get started](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid#installation).
* We started work on an R client for the key-value store [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) by [Coreos](https://coreos.com/), written in [Go](https://golang.org/). [Try it](https://github.com/ropensci/etseed) and contribute.

## Community

* [Jeff Hollister](http://jwhollister.com/) is the new maintainer of the [maptools task view](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools). The `maptools` task view focuses on tools for mapping and visualizing spatial data in R. Thanks Jeff!
* Attendees of our upcoming unconfernce/hackathon in March have started to generate ideas for the event. Check them out at [https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues), and check out the [event site](http://unconf.ropensci.org/). If you want to join remotely, [instructions are in the README](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf#ropensci-2015-unconference).

## In The News

* We're listed in the [UPenn guide for R](http://guides.library.upenn.edu/R). w00t!
* We were delighted to be listed as inspiration for a talk by [Gaurav Kandlikar](https://github.com/gauravsk) on [predator-prey models in R](http://gauravsk.github.io/deSolve/#36).
* We've been added to the [list of Solr clients on the Solr website](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/IntegratingSolr#R). Sweet :)

## Events

__Past events__  
* [Karthik Ram](http://karthik.io/) gave a workshop at Imperial College on tools for [graphical resources for modeling infectious diseases in R](https://sites.google.com/site/hackout2/participants). Details on [our events page](http://ropensci.org/community/events.html).

## Use cases, questions & answers

* In case you aren't aware, we have a shiny new discussion forum based on [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) - it's at [http://discuss.ropensci.org/](http://discuss.ropensci.org/). Join us there!
