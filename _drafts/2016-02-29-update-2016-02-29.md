## Software

* A new package (version `0.3.0`) `solrium` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium). See the vignettes for intros to [solr search](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/search.html), [local Solr setup](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/local_setup.html), [document management](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/document_management.html), and [core/collection management](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/cores_collections.html). This is a reboot of the `solr` package, now compliant with Solr v5 and up, and now with functions for managing cores and collections.
