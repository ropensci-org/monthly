## Software

* The `rvertnet` package update is now on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvertnet/index.html) - we'd love your feedback. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet/releases/tag/v0.2.2) for changes. This version is the first in quite a while, and works with the new [VertNet API](https://github.com/VertNet/webapp/wiki/Introduction-to-the-VertNet-API).
* A new version of `spocc` has been [put on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spocc/index.html). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.2.4) for the changes. No major changes, mostly bug fixes, and slimming down dependencies used in the package.
* A new version of `rplos` has been [put on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rplos/index.html). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.4.6) for the changes. One large change in `rplos` is that you no longer need an API key to use the package - lowering the barrrier to exploring PLOS data!
* Our R client for [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - `elastic` - is now [on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elastic/index.html). Elasticsearch is a powerful NoSQL-style document database - similar to SOLR (p.s. we have [a client for SOLR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/solr/index.html) if you're interested). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.3.0). 
* Welcome a new client to the family: `parasiteR`. [parasiteR](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR) is an R client to work with the [London Natural History Museum's Helminth parasite database](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/index.html).
