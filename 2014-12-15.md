* We just announced that we'll be starting to do community calls, Check out the blog post: http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/12/15/community-calls/
* Patch version `v0.2.1` of rcrossref sent to CRAN. Release notes: https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.2.1 - We're in the process of adding content negotiation to this package, to get full text, where available, across any Crossref member publisher that participates. This will be heavily used in the fulltext package (https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext) to search for full text content. 
* Carl Boettiger, of the rOpenSci leadership team, was at http://www.nescent.org/cal/calendar_detail.php?id=1125 at NESCENT for _Reproducible Science Hackathon: Curriculum & Workflow Development_ - Ciera Martinez will be joining us at our first rOpenSci community call to discuss highlights of this event. 
* Karthik Ram and Scott Chamberlain attended a [PLOS altmetrics conference](http://articlemetrics.github.io/workshop_2014/) in San Francisco. We maintain R clients for [Altmetric.com ](https://github.com/ropensci/raltmetric) and for the PLOS altmetrics application, [Lagotto](https://github.com/ropensci/alm). 
* New version `v0.5` of taxize out. Release notes:  https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.5.0  - Note that this version is not on CRAN as of this date.
* The `elife` R package is tempoxrarily deprecated as they're dropping their API soon https://github.com/ropensci/elife - Let us know if you would use an eLife API so we can communicate that to eLife.

    * Third, Kyle Hamilton joins rOpenSci, with two packages in development. RCryptsy (https://github.com/ropensci/RCryptsy ) is a package to interact with the Public API for the Crypto-Currency exchange Cryptsy (https://www.cryptsy.com/ ). RStars (https://github.com/ropensci/RStars ) is a package to access to the Digital Universe Data set (http://star-api.herokuapp.com/ )
