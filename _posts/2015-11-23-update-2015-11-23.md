## Software

* A package in development for a while now, for making interactive visualizations, `plotly` (version `2.0.2`), is [on CRAN][plotlycran]. It is maintained by the [Plot.ly team](https://plot.ly/), and [Carson Sievert][carson]. `plotly` is an R client for easily translating `ggplot2` graphs to an interactive web-based version and/or create other plot types not available in `ggplot2`. Once uploaded to a plotly account, plotly graphs (and the data behind them) can be viewed and modified in a web browser. See [An overview of plotly’s R API](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ropensci/plotly/master/vignettes/intro.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly).
* A new version (`2.1.0`) of `rfishbase` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rfishbase). [Repository on GitHub][rfishbase].
* A new version (`0.0.7`) of `prism` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/prism). See the [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/prism/blob/master/NEWS.md#changes) for changes.
* A new version (`0.2.1`) of `ecoretriever` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecoretriever). This version adds a new function `get_updates()` to update the retriever scripts; a big improvement as it avoids automatically updating the scripts every time the package is imported. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/ecoretriever/releases/tag/v0.2.1) for changes.
* A new version (`1.0.6`) of `rusda` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rusda). [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/rusda).
* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `brranching` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/brranching). This aims to be an R client for many sources of phylogenies. However, only one source of data is available now: [Phylomatic](http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/). Other data sources will be added. Some sources of phylogenies already have nice R clients so won't be included in this one, e.g., [Open Tree of Life - `rotl`](https://github.com/ropensci/rotl). See [the README](https://github.com/ropensci/brranching#brranching) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/brranching).

## rOpenSci HQ

* We have a paper in _Journal of Open Research Software_ titled [Building Software, Building Community: Lessons from the rOpenSci Project][jors] [^1]

## Use cases

A few recent papers cite rOpenSci software:

* Baden et al. have a paper in _Edinburgh Journal of Botany_ titled [A botanical inventory of forest on karstic limestone and metamorphic substrate in the Chiquibul Forest, Belize, with focus on woody taxa][baden] in which they use and cite [taxize][taxize] [^2]
* Price et al. have a paper in _Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences_ titled [How predation shaped fish: the impact of fin spines on body form evolution across teleosts][price] in which they use and cite [rfishbase][rfishbase] [^3]
* Mindel et al. have a paper in _Journal of Animal Ecology_ titled [A trait-based metric sheds new light on the nature of the body size-depth relationship in the deep sea][mindel] in which they use and cite [rfishbase][rfishbase] [^4]
* Munch and Galizia have a paper in _bioRxiv_ titled [DoOR 2.0 - Comprehensive Mapping of Drosophila melanogaster Odorant Responses][munch] in which they use and cite [webchem][webchem] [^5]
