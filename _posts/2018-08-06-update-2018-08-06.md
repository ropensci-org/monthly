### rOpenSci Unconference

We've got a number of blog posts from our series of posts from teams at our recent [rOpenSci Unconference](http://unconf18.ropensci.org/):

The pkginspector team ([Sam Albers](https://github.com/boshek), [Leonardo Collado-Torres](https://github.com/lcolladotor), [Mauro Lepore](https://github.com/maurolepore), [Joyce Robbins](https://github.com/jtr13), [Omayma Said](https://github.com/OmaymaS), and [Noam Ross](https://github.com/noamross)) wrote about their [pkginspector](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkginspector) project: [What's inside? pkginspector provides helpful tools for inspecting package contents](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/07/17/pkginspector/)
