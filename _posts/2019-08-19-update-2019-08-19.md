CRAN: <img src="../assets/img/octicon-package.png" width="25" style="border-radius: 6px 6px 6px 6px">
GitHub: <img src="../assets/img/github-alt.png" width="25" style="border-radius: 6px 6px 6px 6px">

> There's very little activity in this section because CRAN submissions were closed for the 
last week and a half.

### New Versions

* A new version (`v0.4.0`) of `webmockr` is on CRAN - stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for changes. Checkout the [HTTP testing book](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/http-testing-book/) to get started. {{ "webmockr" | image_cran }} {{ "webmockr" | image_github }}
> fix link to package manual; fix single method request matching
* A new version (`v0.5.19`) of `aRxiv` is on CRAN - Interface to the arXiv API. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv/blob/master/NEWS) for changes. Checkout the [docs](https://docs.ropensci.org/aRxiv/) to get started. {{ "aRxiv" | image_cran }} {{ "aRxiv" | image_github }}
> update vignette; add ORCIDs to DESCRIPTION

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [c14bazAAR][] > Download and Prepare C14 Dates from Different Source Databases
    * Author: [Clemens Schmid](https://github.com/nevrome)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#333](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/333)

## In the News

In a recent blog post [Being a better programmer and scientist with rOpenSci](https://mablab.org/post/ropensci/) Matt Boone of the [Mablab](https://mablab.org) at University of Florida (and an author on the [refnet package under rOpenSci review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/256)) wrote about R and programming, and did a nice job of describing our software review system.

<hr>

In an August 15th article in Forbes [Restrict Twice-As-Deadly SUVs In U.K. Cities, Urge Transport Data Scientists](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2019/08/15/restrict-twice-as-deadly-suvs-in-u-k-cities-urge-transport-data-scientists/), the data used was from the [stplanr][] package maintained by [Robin Lovelace](https://ropensci.org/authors/robin-lovelace/) and others. See also [Robin's tweet](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1162281092096770049) about the article.


<br><br>

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

* The Trafford Data Lab supports government decision-making in Trafford, Greater Manchester, UK. They shared use cases for [ropenaq](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/promoting-r-and-ropensci-packages-in-uk-local-government/1776) to retrieve air quality information from the Manchester Piccadilly monitoring station, [fingertipsR](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-fingertipsr-for-public-health-data-in-uk-local-government/1780) to access public health data on the rate of antidepressant prescribing, and [ghql](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/querying-linked-data-to-improve-public-services/1781) to query linked data to map hot and cold spots of worklessness and improve public services.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
