## Software

### New packages

* A new package `unrtf` (`v1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/unrtf). `unrtf` wraps the [unrtf](https://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/) utility to extract text from rtf files. Check out the [unrtf README](https://github.com/ropensci/unrtf#unrtf) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][unrtf]
* A new package `nneo` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nneo). `nneo` is an R client for the NEON ([National Ecological Observatory Network](http://www.neonscience.org/)) API (<http://data.neonscience.org/data-api>). Check out the [nneo README](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/nneo#nneo) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][nneo]
* A new package `charlatan` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/charlatan). `charlatan` is a package for making fake data. `charlatan` is inspired from and ports many things from Python's <https://github.com/joke2k/faker> library. In turn, `faker` was inspired from PHP's faker, Perl's Faker, and Ruby's faker. `charlatan` went through [rOpenSci review](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/94). Check out the [charlatan vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/charlatan/vignettes/charlatan_vignette.html) to get started. Look out for a blog post coming out later this week on the package. [Repository on GitHub][charlatan]

* A new version (`v0.3.8`) of `crul` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crul). This version adds fixes a bug in `AsyncVaried` to return async responses in the order that they were passed in. This also fixes this exact same behavior in `Async` because `Async` uses `AsyncVaried` internally. Big thanks to [Dirk Schumacher](https://github.com/dirkschumacher) for pointing out the problem. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/crul/releases/tag/v0.3.8) for details. Check out [the vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crul/vignettes/) to get started.

It aims to provide users with a standardized way to automate genome, proteome, coding sequence (CDS), GFF, and metagenome retrieval from NCBI and ENSEMBL databases. This is not the first version on CRAN - but it just completed our software review process and is now in the rOpenSci family - welcome [Hajk-Georg](https://github.com/HajkD)!. Check out [the vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/biomartr/vignettes/) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][biomartr]

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
