## rOpenSci HQ

rOpenSci Unconference is happening this week!  From 25-26 May, we're having our fourth annual rOpenSci Unconference <http://unconf17.ropensci.org/> in Los Angeles, CA. You can follow the event with the hashtag `#runconf17`.

<br><br>

## Software

### New packages

* A new package `webmockr` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/webmockr). `webmockr` is an R library for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests. It integrates with [crul][crul] right now, but will integrate with other HTTP libraries in the future (e.g., `curl`). In addition, this package will be used to make [vcr][vcr] possible - a package for mocking HTTP requests, mainly for use in test suites (also going to CRAN soon). Check out the [webmockr README](https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr#webmockr) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][webmockr]

### Releases

* A new version (`v0.2.0`) of `hoardr` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hoardr). This version made some minor changes about writing to disk for caching files, and other minor changes. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/hoardr/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for details. Check out [the vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hoardr/vignettes/hoardr_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][hoardr]

* A new version (`v0.4.2`) of `rerddap` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap). This version adds use of [hoardr][hoardr] for caching files and adds a suite of functions for managing cached files. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap/releases/tag/v0.4.2) for details. Check out the two vignettes to get started. [Repository on GitHub][rerddap]
* A new version (`v1.0.4`) of `lingtypology` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/lingtypology).

* A new version (`v0.1.2`) of `crminer` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crminer). This version now uses [hoardr][hoardr] for caching; exposes new object `crm_cache` for user to manage cached files, via [hoardr][hoardr].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [roadoi][] > Find Free Versions of Scholarly Publications via the oaDOI Service
    * Author: [Najko Jahn](https://github.com/njahn82)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#115](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/115)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Ross Mounce](https://github.com/rossmounce)
        * [Tuija Sonkkila](https://github.com/tts)


<br><br>
