## Software

* A new package `ropenaq` (`v0.1.1`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ropenaq). `ropenaq` provides access to air quality data from the API of the OpenAQ platform <https://docs.openaq.org/>, with the different services the API offers (getting measurements for a given query, getting latest measurements, getting lists of available countries/cities/locations). For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ropenaq/vignettes/Ropenaq-vignette.html). [Repository on GitHub][ropenaq].
* A new package `rgeospatialquality` (`v0.3.2`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgeospatialquality). `rgeospatialquality` provides native wrappers for the functions available via the spatial quality REST API described at <http://bit.ly/bioinformatics_btw057>. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgeospatialquality/vignettes/geospatial-quality-api.html). [Repository on GitHub][rgeospatialquality].
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `ritis` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ritis). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/ritis/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for more, and see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ritis/vignettes/ritis_vignette.html) for an introduction to the package. This is a re-boot of `ritis`, overhauled to use the new JSON API, instead of XML, and functions reworked internally, reduced complexity. [Repository on GitHub][ritis].
* A new version (`0.1.2`) of `gutenbergr` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gutenbergr). `gutenbergr` is an R package to help you download and process public domain works from Project Gutenberg. See the [NEWS](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gutenbergr/blob/master/NEWS.md#gutenbergr-012) for changes. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gutenbergr/vignettes/intro.html). [Repository on GitHub][gutenbergr].
* A new version (`2.0.7`) of `RNeXML` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RNeXML). `RNeXML` is an R package to provide access to phyloinformatic data in 'NeXML' format. See the [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/blob/master/NEWS#L31) for changes. For an introduction to the package see the vignettes linked on the CRAN landing page. [Repository on GitHub][RNeXML].
* A new version (`0.9.4`) of `rgbif` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). `rgbif` is an R interface to the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](http://www.gbif.org/) API. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.9.4) for changes. This version adds a new vignette, switches to using `tibble` for data.frame's, ands includes some minor improvements and bug fixes. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif/vignettes/rgbif_vignette.html). [Repository on GitHub][rgbif].
* A new version (`0.2.3`) of `osmplotr` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/osmplotr). `osmplotr` provides customisable images of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and data visualisation using OSM objects. See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/osmplotr/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][osmplotr].
* A new version (`1.4.2`) of `hunspell` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). `hunspell` is a spell checker and morphological analyzer library designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word compounding or character encoding. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/releases/tag/v1.4.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `geojsonio` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio). `geojsonio` does I/O for GeoJSON. This version brings a major performance improvement for `geojsonio::geojson_json()` by moving to reading in `json` with `readr::read_file()`. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][geojsonio].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following package recently made it through our onboarding process:

* [europepmc][europepmc]
    * Author: [Najko Jahn](https://github.com/njahn82)
    * Review: [ropensci/onboarding#29](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/29)
    * Reviewer: [Toph Allen](https://github.com/toph-allen)

<br><br>

## Use cases

Four recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software (or reference rOpenSci):

* Weber _et al_. cite [taxize][taxize] in their paper [Foliar nectar enhances plant–mite mutualisms: the effect of leaf sugar on the control of powdery mildew by domatia-inhabiting mites](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw118) [^1]
* Madden _et al_. cite [rAlmteric][raltmetric] in their paper [Knowledge Dissemination of Intimate Partner Violence Intervention Studies Measured Using Alternative Metrics: Results From a Scoping Review](https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260516657914) [^2]
* Michonneau _et al_. wrote a paper describing [rotl][rotl], and cite our [traits][traits] package in their paper [rotl: an R package to interact with the Open Tree of Life data](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.12593) [^3]
* Wagner cited [taxize][taxize] in her paper [A review of software tools for spell-checking taxon names in vegetation databases](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12432) [^4]
