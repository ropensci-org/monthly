## Software

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `rredlist` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rredlist). `rredlist` is an R client for the [IUCN Red List API](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs). The IUCN Red List is a global list of threatened and endangered species. See the [README](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rredlist#rredlist) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub][rredlist].
* A new package (version `0.2.0`) `mapr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mapr). `mapr` helps vizualize species occurrence data, and includes functions to 'vizualize' occurrence data from `spocc`, `rgbif`, and other packages. Mapping options included for base R plots, `ggplot2`, and various interactive maps includingn `Leaflet.js`. `mapr` is actually a re-boot of the package `spoccutils` - which used to have mapping and cleaning functionality. Now `mapr` has mapping functionality and a new package [scrubr][scrubr] has data cleaning functionality. See the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mapr/vignettes/mapr_vignette.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub][mapr].
* A new version (version `0.0.5`) of `webchem` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/webchem/). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/releases/tag/v0.0.5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][webchem].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `elastic` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic). This version adds many new features, including backwards compatibility with most Elasticsearch versions, much better errors including ability to pick verbose error messaging. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for complete list of changes. [Repository on GitHub][elastic].
* A new version (`0.3.4`) of `rerddap` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/). This version replaces `ncdf` with `ncdf4`, and fails more gracefully now. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap/releases/tag/v0.3.4) for complete list of changes. [Repository on GitHub][rerddap].
* A new version (`0.1.6`) of `geojsonio` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/releases/tag/v0.1.6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][geojsonio].
* A new version (`0.1.1`) of `stplanr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stplanr). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/releases/tag/0.1.1) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][stplanr].
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `rcrossref` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref). This version includes a new low-level API for fast access to the Crossref API; support for deep paging via Crossref's Solr cursor functionality; and more. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for complete list of changes. [Repository on GitHub][rcrossref].
* A new version (`0.1.6`) of `fulltext` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fulltext). `ft_get_si()` improvements. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/releases/tag/v0.1.6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][fulltext].
* A new version (`0.5.2`) of `rnoaa` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). Two new data sources: ARGO buoy data via [http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/](http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/) and [CO-OPS tide and current data](http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/api/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.5.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa].
* A new version (`0.4.5`) of `spocc` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.4.5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][spocc].

## Community

* We will have our 9th community call on March 2nd at 9 am PST with [Dr. Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) talking about her [Google Spreadsheets R API](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). More details at [ropensci/commcalls#9](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9).

## In the news

* Virginia Gewin has a _Nature_ magazine piece titled [Data sharing: An open mind on open data][gewin] that mentions rOpenSci, with a quote from our very own Karthik Ram. [^1]

## Use cases

Seven recent papers cite and/or rOpenSci software:
