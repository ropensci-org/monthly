## Software

* The `rvertnet` package update is now on [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rvertnet/index.html) - we'd love your feedback. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet/releases/tag/v0.2.2) for changes. This version is the first in quite a while, and works with the new [VertNet API](https://github.com/VertNet/webapp/wiki/Introduction-to-the-VertNet-API). VertNet has [a blog post](http://blog.vertnet.org/post/108840046776/rev-up-your-research-with-the-all-new-rvertnet) about the new version. 
* A new version of `spocc` has been [put on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc/index.html). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.2.4) for the changes. No major changes, mostly bug fixes, and slimming down dependencies used in the package.
* A new version of `rplos` has been [put on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos/index.html). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.4.6) for the changes. One large change in `rplos` is that you no longer need an API key to use the package - lowering the barrier to exploring PLOS data!
* Our R client for [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) - `elastic` - is now [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic/index.html). Elasticsearch is a powerful NoSQL-style document database - similar to SOLR (p.s. we have [a client for SOLR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solr/index.html) if you're interested). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.3.0). 
* Welcome a new client to the family: `parasiteR`. [parasiteR](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR) is an R client to work with the [London Natural History Museum's Helminth parasite database](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/scientific-resources/taxonomy-systematics/host-parasites/index.html).

## Community

* We announced our [upcoming unconference and hackathon](http://unconf.ropensci.org/) on March 26-27 in San Francisco. There are still spaces if you would like to attend. [Nominate yourself](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14nY7-6CdTKFb7A3j07KAayVqIqgDAzQgdRtyMLr8RiQ/viewform) by February 15th if you'd like to attend.
* We gained two new contributors! Check out our [community page](http://ropensci.org/community/#community).
    * Chris Ray is is a postdoc at the [Institute for Bird Populations](http://www.birdpop.org/). She contributes to [rvertnet](https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet).
    * Tad Dallas is a graduate student in the [University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu/). He maintains [parasiteR](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR).

## In The News

* rOpenSci got a mention in Hadley Wickham's article [Impact the world by being useful](http://bulletin.imstat.org/2014/12/hadley-wickham-impact-the-world-by-being-useful/)
* We were highlighted in [GBIF's page for applications](http://www.gbif.org/usingdata/dataapplications)
* rOpenSci is listed on [Connected Researchers](http://connectedresearchers.com/) for [digital tools for researchers](http://connectedresearchers.com/online-tools-for-researchers/).
* We were mentioned in the Coursera course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/)

## Events

__Past events__  
* [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/) gave a workshop on using rOpenSci packages at the Davis (CA) R user group. Check out the recording at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVRxq-hS9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVRxq-hS9M), the [talk materials](https://github.com/ropensci/workshops-davis-2015-01), and [a zip file of the materials](https://github.com/ropensci/workshops-davis-2015-01/archive/gh-pages.zip).

__Upcoming events__  
* [Karthik Ram](http://karthik.io/) will be at a workshop at Imperial College to work on tools for [graphical resources for modeling infectious diseases in R](https://sites.google.com/site/hackout2/participants). Karthik will also be running a workshop in Seville on the 16th and 17th. Details on [our events page](http://ropensci.org/community/events.html).

## Use cases, questions & answers

* We recently talked with folks doing neurobiology research and were curious if there's any way we can help. We started a thread in our discussion forum if you have any thoughts: [http://discuss.ropensci.org/t/neurobiology-data/112](http://discuss.ropensci.org/t/neurobiology-data/112)
