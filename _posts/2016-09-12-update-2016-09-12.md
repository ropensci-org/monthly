## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following package recently went through our onboarding process and has been approved:


* [monkeylearn][]
    * Author: [Maëlle Salmon](https://github.com/masalmon)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#45](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/45)
