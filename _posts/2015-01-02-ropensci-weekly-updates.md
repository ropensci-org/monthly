title:  "rOpenci Weekly updates"

We've found it useful to collate all the notable things that happened in the last week or two with software, community, and events within rOpenSci - and send that around within our leadership team. We thought this might be useful to users, developers, and others in our community. Thus, we're starting a new series of emails to send to this mailing list. These __rOpenSci Weekly Updates__ will list all notable software updates, activity in our community (new members, cool things members have done, etc.), events in our community, and rOpenSci mentions in the news. As we all dislike getting too many emails, we're only sending an update bi-weekly, or twice per month, on Mondays.

We've already done a few of these. You can find those at:

* 2014-12-15 - [http://ropensci.github.io/weekly/weekly-update-2014-12-15/](http://ropensci.github.io/weekly/weekly-update-2014-12-15/)
* 2014-12-22 - [http://ropensci.github.io/weekly/weekly-update-2014-12-22/](http://ropensci.github.io/weekly/weekly-update-2014-12-22/)

The next one will be this upcoming Monday, 2015-01-05.

Let us know if you have any feedback!
