## Software

### New packages

* A new package `crul` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crul). `crul` is a simple HTTP client, with tools for making HTTP requests, and soon will include tools for mocking HTTP requests. The package is built on R6, and takes inspiration from Ruby's `faraday` gem (<https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday>). `crul` is built on top of the R `curl` package, an interface to `libcurl`. Check out the [intro vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crul/vignettes/crul_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][crul]
* A new package `geojson` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojson). `geojson` defines geojson classes, similar to the `sp` package, and aims to deal only with geojson data, without requiring any of the `rgdal`/`rgeos` stack. That means this package is light weight. We'll continue to integrate these geojson classes with our other geospatial packages, and new packages in development. Check out the intro vignettes (<https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojson/vignettes/geojson.html>, <https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojson/vignettes/geojson-operations.html>) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][geojson]
* A new package `fauxpas` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fauxpas). `fauxpas` provides HTTP condition helpers. Methods are included for general purpose HTTP error handling, as well as individual methods for every HTTP status code, both via status code numbers as well as their descriptive names. Supports ability to adjust behavior to stop, message or warning. Includes ability to use custom whisker template to have any configuration of status code, short description, and verbose message. Currently supports integration with `crul`, `curl`, and `httr`. Check out the [README](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/fauxpas#fauxpas) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][fauxpas]

### Releases

* A new version (`2.2`) of `hunspell` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/blob/master/NEWS) for changes. This version includes a fix for certain compilers. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `rcrossref` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for changes. This version adds support for [field queries](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#field-queries), now uses `rappdirs` for caching, updates to docs for new pagination rules and rate limiting. Many functions now defunct: `cr_search`, `cr_search_free`, `crosscite`, `cr_fundref`. [Repository on GitHub][rcrossref].
* A new version (`0.7.8`) of `elastic` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.7.8) for changes. This version adds new functions `docs_update` to do partial document updates and `docs_bulk_prep` to make bulk load format files to load data into Elasticsearch outside of R. Some bug fixes as well. [Repository on GitHub][elastic].
* A new version (`1.2`) of `tesseract` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tesseract). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract/blob/master/NEWS) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][tesseract].
* A new version (`0.1.6`) of `stplanr` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stplanr). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/releases/tag/0.1.6) for changes. This version adds new function `od_id_order`, adds some new arguments to `line2route`, and includes some bug fixes. [Repository on GitHub][stplanr].
* A new version (`4.5.6`) of `plotly` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/plotly). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/blob/master/NEWS.md#456) for changes. This version adds support for timezones in `scale_datetime`, requires `ggplot2` `>2.1.0`, and many other changes and bug fixes. [Repository on GitHub][plotly].
* A new version (`0.6.6`) of `rnoaa` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.6.6) for changes. This version now imports `isdparser` to do ISD parsing (relates to the `isd()` and similar functions). Improved docs, and fixed some bugs. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa].
* A new version (`0.1.1.1`) of `webchem` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/webchem). [Repository on GitHub][webchem].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `rsnps` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rsnps). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rsnps/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. This version includes bug fixes for `fetch_genotypes` and `ld_search`. To make function names more consistent (lower case and snake_case), `LDSearch()` is now `ld_search()`, `NCBI_snp_query()` is now `ncbi_snp_query()`, and `NCBI_snp_query2()` is now `ncbi_snp_query2()` - but all are synonymized, so either work for now, but the uppercase versions will be defunct in the next version that hits CRAN. In addition, fixed base URLs for some of the APIs - between last release and now, many have changed to `https` from `http`. [Repository on GitHub][rsnps].
* A new version (`0.16.0`) of `git2r` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/git2r). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/releases/tag/v0.16.0) for changes. This version includes update to `libgit2` version, and many other improvements. [Repository on GitHub][git2r].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages! 

There haven't been any submissions or approved packages since last news - so please do submit your packages!  At least ask questions if you're not sure how it works, or if your package is a good fit. 

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
