## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [osmdata][] > Download OpenStreetMap data 
    * Author: [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/    )
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#103](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/103)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Edzer Pebesma](https://github.com/edzer)
        * [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv)

## On the blog

### Onboarding series

We're doing a series of guest blog posts for packages that have gone through our software review process at [ropensci/onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/).

The 4th post came out last week, by [Lukas Lundstrom](https://github.com/lukas-rokka) on his package [camsRad][] - [camsRad, satellite-based time series of solar irradiation](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/03/21/camsrad).

3rd: [Claudia Vitolo](https://claudiavitolo.com/) on her package [hddtools][] - [Discover hydrological data using the hddtools R package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/03/07/hddtools).

2nd: [Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/) on her package [ropenaq][] - [ropenaq, a breath of fresh air/R](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/21/ropenaq).

1st: [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan) on his package [plater][] - [From a million nested `ifelse`s to the plater package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/06/plater-blog-post).

We'll have more posts in this series coming out soon - keep an eye out.
