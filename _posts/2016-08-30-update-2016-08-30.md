## Software

### New packages

* A new package `getlandsat` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/getlandsat). `getlandsat` is an R client to get Landsat 8 Data from Amazon Web Services (AWS) public data sets (<https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/landsat/>). Includes functions for listing images and fetching them, and handles caching to prevent unnecessary additional requests. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/getlandsat/vignettes/getlandsat_vignette.html). [Repository on GitHub][getlandsat].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!
