## Software

### New packages

* A new package `xslt` (`v1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/xslt). `xslt` is an extension for the [xml2][] package to transform XML documents by applying an [XSL](https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/WhatIsXSL.html) stylesheet. Check out Jeroen's recent [blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/01/10/xslt-release) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][xslt]
* A new package `rjsonapi` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rjsonapi). `rjsonapi` is an R client for APIs that follow the JSONAPI spec. The client is mostly for consuming data from [JSON APIs](http://jsonapi.org/), but there is an experimental server using [plumber][], which will in future help you serve a JSON API. There's not a lot of public APIs following JSON API right now, but there likely will be in the future. Check out the [README](https://github.com/ropensci/rjsonapi#rjsonapi) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][rjsonapi]

### Releases

* A new version (`v0.1.4`) of `natserv` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/natserv). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/natserv/releases/tag/v0.1.4) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][natserv].

* A new version (`v0.4.0`) of `bold` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/bold). This version includes a new function `bold_identify_parents()` to add taxonomic hierarchy information to the output of `bold_identify()`. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][bold].
* A new version (`v0.1.2`) of `europepmc` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/europepmc). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/europepmc/releases/tag/0.1.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][europepmc].

* A new version (`v0.3.0`) of `rredlist` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rredlist). This version adds `rl_occ_country()` and `rl_occ_country_()` and now uses [crul][] as its HTTP client. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rredlist/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rredlist].
* A new version (`v1.1.2`) of `rnbn` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnbn). This version adds a startup message to notify users about `rnbn` being archived soon - a new package will replace it - based on a new UK NBN backend.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process and is undergoing review:

* [visdat][] > makes it easy to visualise your whole dataset so that you
    can visually identify problems
    * Author: [Nicholas Tierney](https://github.com/njtierney)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#87](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/87)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan)
        * [Mara Averick](https://github.com/batpigandme)

## Use cases

Two blog posts and many new (and some old) papers cite rOpenSci packages:

* Ummel cited [geonames][] in his white paper [CARMA Revisited: An Updated Database of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Power Plants Worldwide](http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1426429). [^1]
* LeBauer _et al_. use and cite our [traits][] package in their paper [BETYdb: a yield, trait, and ecosystem service database applied to second-generation bioenergy feedstock production](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12420) [^2]
* [Oyungerel Munkhbat](https://twitter.com/moyungrl) (with [Maëlle Salmon's](https://github.com/masalmon) help) used [ropenaq][] in her piece [Putting a magnifying glass on air pollution](http://theubpost.mn/2017/01/12/putting-a-magnifying-glass-on-air-pollution) [^3]
