## rOpenSci HQ

We've just released the fifth version (v0.5) of the [rOpenSci Developer Guide](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/10/22/devguide-0.5.0/). Some noteable updates:
    
- New chapter: [rOpenSci package curation policy](https://devguide.ropensci.org/curationpolicy.html)
- Guidance for package docs
- Updated rOpenSci software review guidance
- Changes to unit testing recommendations

<br>

On Oct 22, our Community Manager Stefanie Butland, and Software Peer Review Editor Brooke Anderson, presented to [R-Ladies East Lansing](https://twitter.com/RLadiesELansing) and [Chicago](https://twitter.com/RLadiesChicago) about our [Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) and software peer review process. [Brooke's slides](https://github.com/geanders/GuestLectures/blob/master/RLadies_meeting/rladies_workshop_2020.pdf)

## Software Review ✔

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

It's time for another installment of ... [2 Months in 2 Minutes - rOpenSci News, October 2020](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/10/15/news-oct2020/) - if you want a brief summary of the last 2 months of these newsletters, these blog posts are for you (written by [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/))

<br>

[Zhang-He Goh](https://ropensci.org/author/zhang-he-goh/), [Jonny Coates](https://ropensci.org/author/jonny-coates/), and [Hugo Gruson](https://ropensci.org/author/hugo-gruson/) wrote a blog post that was [cross-posted on the preLights blog](https://prelights.biologists.com/news/covidpreprints-com-automating-website-updates-with-the-europepmc-and-raltmetric-packages/): [Covidpreprints.com: Automating Website Updates with the europepmc and rAltmetric Packages](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/10/13/covidpreprints/). In the post, they detail how they have used rOpenSci packages [rAltmetric][] and [europepmc][] (in addition to other R packages) to automate updating `covidpreprints.com`.

__Software Review__

[Luke McGuinness](https://ropensci.org/author/luke-mcguinness/) wrote about his recently rOpenSci reviewed package [medrxivr][]: [Searching medRxiv and bioRxiv Preprint Data
](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/10/20/searching-medrxivr-and-biorxiv-preprint-data/). He discusses the motivation behind the package, and highlights cases for medrxivr.

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [Stéphane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

*We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:*

- [monkeylearn][]: The current maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. [Comment on this thread](https://github.com/ropensci/monkeylearn/issues/142) if you're interested.
