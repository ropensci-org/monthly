## Software

### New packages

* A new package `graphql` (`v1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/graphql). `graphql` provides bindings to the [libgraphqlparser C++ library](https://github.com/graphql/libgraphqlparser). [Repository on GitHub][graphql]
* A new package `plater` (`v1.0.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/plater). `plater` provides tools for interacting with data from experiments done in microtiter plates.
You can easily read in plate-shaped data and convert it to tidy format, combine plate-shaped data with tidy data, and view tidy data in plate shape. Maintained by [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan). For an introduction to the package see the [introductory vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/plater/vignettes/plater-basics.html). [Repository on GitHub][plater]

### Releases

* A new version (`0.5.4`) of `spocc` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.5.4) for changes. This version has a number of bug fixes, and forces newer versions of some dependencies, also which have had fixes in them. Do upgrade! [Repository on GitHub][spocc].
* A new version (`0.2.4`) of `pangaear` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pangaear). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/pangaear/releases/tag/v0.2.4) for changes. This version improves documentation, and changes internal code that fetches data from the website as Pangaea website structure has changed. `pg_search()` in older versions won't work now, do upgrade. [Repository on GitHub][pangaear].
* A new version (`0.6.4`) of `rnoaa` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.6.4) for changes. This version of `rnoaa` gains a function `isd_read` to let users read in ISD data in following R sessions (whereas `isd()` downloads and reads data). All the functions in `rnoaa` that used to download from NOAA FTP servers into files in your home directory now use `rappdirs` to determine where to download based on your OS. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa].
* A new version (`0.9.5`) of `rgbif` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.9.5) for changes. `occ_search()` gains facetting functionality, and a new function `occ_facet()` to only do facetting, with no occurrence data; see examples in the docs. A suite of new parameters have been added to `occ_search()` and `occ_data()`. [Repository on GitHub][rgbif].
* A new version (`0.4.0`) of `solrium` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for changes. Many minor improvements, including replacing `XML` with `xml2`, fixes to `solr_group()`, and now using `tibble` for compact data.frame representation rather than custom internal code.  [Repository on GitHub][solrium].
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `rbison` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rbison). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rbison/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rbison].
* A new version (`2.1`) of `hunspell` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/blob/master/NEWS) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`1.4.5`) of `RSelenium` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RSelenium). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/blob/master/NEWS) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][RSelenium].

### Package notes

The package `spoccutils` is now archived on CRAN. It was originally broken out of `spocc` for two reasons: 1) to allow `spocc` to focus on only retrieving species occurrence data, and 2) to make it easy to __clean__ and __map__ data from `spocc` outputs. We learned through time that the R community could use more general purpose tools for __cleaning__ and __mapping__ species occurrence data; that is, tools that aren't tied to the output of `spocc`, but any species occurrence data. Check out [mapr][mapr] for mapping species occurrence data with lots of different formats (base plots, ggplot, ggmap, leaflet, etc.) and [scrubr][scrubr] for cleaning species occurrence data.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following packages recently went through our onboarding process and have been approved:

* [plater][] > Tools to Make it Easy to Work with Microtiter Plate-Shaped Data
    * Author: [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#60](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/60)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali)
        * [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia)
* [rdefra][] > Interact with the UK AIR Pollution Database from DEFRA
    * Author: [Claudia Vitolo](https://github.com/cvitolo)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#68](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/68)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Maëlle Salmon](https://github.com/masalmon)
        * [Hao Zhu](https://github.com/haozhu233)

The following was recently submitted to our onboarding process and is undergoing review:

* [refimpact][] > API Wrapper for the UK REF 2014 Impact Case Studies Database
    * Author: [Perry Stephenson](https://github.com/perrystephenson)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#78](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/78)
    * Reviewers: _not assigned yet_

## Use cases

One recent book review cites rOpenSci:

* Lovelace mentions rOpenSci in his book review of [The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences](https://doi.org/10.1111/jors.12293)

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is holding a competition for apps that use GBIF data. It's called the [Ebbe Nielsen Challenge](http://gbif2016.devpost.com/). We make the most widely used client for acquiring GBIF data: [rgbif](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif). `rgbif` is used in at least the following entries to the competition:

* [GBIFgaps](http://devpost.com/software/gbifgaps) - [source code](https://github.com/jrfep/GBIFgaps) - uses [rgbif][rgbif]
* [BioGeoBias](http://devpost.com/software/biogeobias) - [source code](https://github.com/JanLauGe/BioGeoBias) - uses [rgbif][rgbif]
* [Species Index of Primary Biodiversity Information](http://devpost.com/software/species-index-of-primary-biodiversity-information) - (full disclosure: I'm on the team for this one) - uses [taxize][taxize] and [rgbif][rgbif]
