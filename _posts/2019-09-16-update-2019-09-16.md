## rOpenSci HQ

* Join us for our next community call on [Reproducible Workflows at Scale with drake](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/08/08/commcall-sep2019/) on Sep 24th, 2019. The speaker is [drake][] developer [Will Landau](https://ropensci.org/authors/will-landau/).
* Help wanted! We encourage rOpenSci package authors to help us help you get more contributors to your package. If you label an issue "help wanted" (no hyphen or emojis), those issues can be found in a [search of the rOpenSci organization](
https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A"help+wanted"+state%3Aopen&type=Issues); and on the rOpenSci GitHub landing page <https://github.com/ropensci> the number of open help wanted issues is highlighted for each package that has them.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

* [Noam Ross](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) wrote about [Using rorcid to generate a website CV](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-rorcid-to-generate-a-website-cv/1806). The [rorcid][] package, made by rOpenSci, is a client for [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) data.
* [Tim Williams](https://github.com/NovasTaylor) wrote about using our [rdflib][] package (a high level wrapper around the redland package for common rdf applications): [Converting MedDRA Terminology to Linked Data using rdflib](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/converting-meddra-terminology-to-linked-data-using-rdflib/1824).

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
