## rOpenSci Community Calls

- We’re planning a Community Call on Research Applications of rOpenSci Taxonomy and Biodiversity Tools and we want your input! What types of questions do you try to address with these tools? How do you use the tools to address your questions? Please tell us about your examples using the template in our discussion forum [UseCases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases).

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

## On the blog

### Software Review

[Layik Hama](https://ropensci.org/authors/layik-hama/) and [Robin Lovelace](https://ropensci.org/authors/robin-lovelace/) wrote a summary of their recently onboarded package [stats19][]: [stats19: a package for road safety research](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/02/26/stats19/). In it, they describe the motivation for the package and go through a detailed run through of using the package.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had three recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)

We've got three packages in need of new maintainers:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard Szöcs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
- [rsnps][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
- [rdpla][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
