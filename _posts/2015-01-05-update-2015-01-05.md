## Software

* The first version of `gistr` (`v0.1.0`) is up on CRAN. `gistr` is an R client for working with GitHub gists. You can get gists and their metadata, and create them. A blog post describing the package: [http://recology.info/2015/01/gistr-github-gists/](http://recology.info/2015/01/gistr-github-gists/)
* `rvertnet` is getting a reworking based on the new Vertnet APIs. Check out the `udpate` branch in the repo: [https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet/tree/update](https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet/tree/update)
* `ckanr` got a pull request from [Imanuel Costigan](https://github.com/imanuelcostigan), allowing easier setting of the base url for the CKAN instance. See gist for use: [https://gist.github.com/sckott/c86f3c2965cfc389ac3c](https://gist.github.com/sckott/c86f3c2965cfc389ac3c)
* We shared a Gist on getting elevation data for lat/long locations in the `rgbif` package via the Google Elevation API ([https://gist.github.com/sckott/2d3ae5f0cecca3deb436](https://gist.github.com/sckott/2d3ae5f0cecca3deb436)), and there was a cool look by [Matt Harris](https://twitter.com/Md_Harris) at how accurate the Google Elevation API is compared to Digital Elevation Models: [http://rpubs.com/mharris/GoogleAPI](http://rpubs.com/mharris/GoogleAPI)
* We shared another Gist on getting NOAA NCDC data via FTP [https://gist.github.com/sckott/440222f040a3444057ad](https://gist.github.com/sckott/440222f040a3444057ad) - attempting to cover the use case where the [NOAA NCDC API](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) rate limits are lower than your data needs. 

## Community

* New R package in the rOpenSci suite, [rdopa](https://github.com/ropensci/rdopa), an R client to [Joint Research Centre's DOPA REST API](http://dopa-services.jrc.ec.europa.eu/rest/). This is also gives us a new contributor! [Joona LehtomÃ¤ki](https://github.com/jlehtoma) 
* New contibutor to rOpenSci via `rvertnet`: [Chris Ray](https://github.com/Pika8tona)
* Our new [rOpenSci discussion forum](http://discuss.ropensci.org/) is growing fast. Do join us there if you want to discuss all things rOpenSci. There's login options for email, Twitter, GitHub, and Mozilla Persona. 

## rOpenSci in the news

* rOpenSci got a mention in the bioRxiv preprint _Connecting people and ideas from around the world: global innovation platforms for next-generation ecology and beyond_ by the [INGEE](http://innge.net/) folks. See the abstract at [http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/12/14/012666.abstract](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/12/14/012666.abstract)
* We (and [rOpenGov!](http://ropengov.github.io/)) got a mention in a manuscript in draft at [muuankarski/rlang](https://github.com/muuankarski/rlang) on GitHub. [pdf here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muuankarski/rlang/master/r_lang.pdf)

> Other such domain specific projects are for example rOpenSci and emerging rOpenGov that provide tools for open science and open government data, respectively.

* A mention in [a PeerJ preprint](https://peerj.com/preprints/235v1.pdf) titled _Close connections between open science and open-source software_. The mention is 

> Recently, rOpenSci (http://ropensci.org/) is released as a new in-progress collaborative project aiming to effectively and synergistically connect various online databases through R computing platform.
