## Software Review ✔

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## On the blog

[Liam Brierley](https://ropensci.org/author/liam-brierley/) wrote a very nice post on our blog about using some rOpenSci tools to study Coronaviruses: [Using Open-Access Tools (rentrez, taxize) to Find Coronaviruses, Their Genetic Sequences, and Their Hosts](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/11/10/coronaviruses-and-hosts/)

### Tech notes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/author/scott-chamberlain/) wrote a post titled [fulltext: Behind the Scenes](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/11/17/fulltext-story/), going behind the scenes of the [fulltext][] package. The post describes the wandering path the package has gone through to help R users obtain full text versions of scholarly articles for text-mining, including working with Crossref, to building custom web APIs and balancing performance against other considerations.

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [Stéphane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)
