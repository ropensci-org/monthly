## Software Review ‚úî

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

No new submissions or approved submissions.

## On the blog

It's time for another installment of ... [2 Months in 2 Minutes - rOpenSci News, February 2020](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/08/20/news-aug2020/) - if you want a brief summary of the last 2 months of these newsletters, these blog posts are for you (written by [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/))

<br>

Software Review:

[Jonathan Keane](https://ropensci.org/author/jonathan-keane/) wrote about their recently rOpenSci reviewed package [dittodb][]: [Developing dittodb](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/08/18/dev-dittodb/). Jonathan discusses the motivation behind the package, some of the technical challenges, and the story behind the name of the package.

<br>

### Tech notes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/author/scott-chamberlain/) wrote a post on [Scientific Name Parsing: rgnparser and namext](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/08/25/scientific-name-parsing/), covering the [rgnparser][] and [namext][] packages.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

A new use case was shared in the forum over the past two weeks since our last newsletter:

* [Georgios Karamanis](https://twitter.com/geokaramanis) shared: [Bar chart portraits](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/bar-chart-portraits/2197); the use case employed the [magick][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/author/jeroen-ooms/)


<br><br>


## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [St√©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)
