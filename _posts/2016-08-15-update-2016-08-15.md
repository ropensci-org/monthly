* A new package `mregions` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mregions). `mregions` is an R client for searching for and retrieving marine regions information and data. Data comes from <http://www.marineregions.org/> and [Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) geoserver](http://geo.vliz.be/geoserver/web). The main product given back in the package to the user are shape, geojson, or wkt data that can be used downstream to map/analyze other data. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mregions/vignettes/mregions.html). [Repository on GitHub][mregions].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

## Use cases

Four recent papers and one poster/shiny app cite and/or use rOpenSci software:

* Jahn and Tullney cite [rcrossref][] in paper [A study of institutional spending on open access publication fees in Germany](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2323) [^1]
* Groom _et al._ cite [rgbif][]  in a paper [Is citizen science an open science in the case of biodiversity observations?](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12767) [^2]
* Bosch _et al._ have created a Shiny application [Marinespeed](http://marinespeed.org) that uses a [rgbif][] and [Reol][]. Check out the [code for the Shiny app](https://github.com/samuelbosch/marinespeed) and a recent [poster for the app](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/293564.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm2HgNtfkMhqb6QXy6nwOGAu4koFBQ&nossl=1&oi=scholaralrt)
* Pirhadi _et al._ cite [webchem][] in a paper [Open Source Molecular Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2016.07.008) [^3]
* Wais cites [gender][] in a paper [Gender Prediction Methods Based on First Names with genderizeR](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/wais.pdf) [^4]
