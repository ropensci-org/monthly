## rOpenSci HQ

* We're hiring a community manager! Read about the position [on our blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/10/community-manager-position) to find out more. Informal questions and inquiries welcome at `jobs at ropensci org`.
* For the first time, we have an rOpenSci [unconference in Australia](http://auunconf.ropensci.org). It will be 21-22 April in Brisbane. If you want to go be sure to apply before April 1st at [auunconf.ropensci.org/#apply](http://auunconf.ropensci.org/#apply). Read more about the event on our blog in a [post by Nicholas Tierney](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/09/au-unconf-down-under).
* We've done a few [rOpenSci office hours](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/ropensci-office-hours/312). The last one we had two people! We'd like to keep the momentum going. Join us this week! Thursday at 9 AM PST

* Video and notes from our [9th community call](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9) are up on Vimeo on [our community calls channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/rocommunitycalls). The recording was a bit longer than normal, so it's split up into two parts: [part 1](https://vimeo.com/158445563) and [part 2](https://vimeo.com/158445864).

## CRAN dependencies

* [gistr][gistr] has a new package that imports it on CRAN: [rbokeh][rbokeh] - an R interface to Bokeh [http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/).

## Use cases

One recent paper cites rOpenSci software:

* Sessa and Der cite and use [chromer][chromer] (an R client for interacting with the [chromosome counts database](http://ccdb.tau.ac.il)) in their paper [Evolutionary Genomics of Ferns and Lycophytes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065229616300052) [^1]
