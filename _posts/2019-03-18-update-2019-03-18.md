## rOpenSci HQ

- Our next Community Call on Research Applications of rOpenSci Taxonomy and Biodiversity Tools is coming up next week! See our [recent blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/03/11/commcall-mar2019/) for all the details.
- Weâ€™re planning a Community Call on Security for R with Ildi Czeller & Bob Rudis. Create Your Own Security Adventure by [telling us what you want to know about the topic](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/community-call-security-for-r-create-your-own-security-adventure/1612).
- Our citations Twitter bot [@rocitations](https://twitter.com/rocitations) ([src code](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rocites)) tweets new citations of rOpenSci software. You can now contribute citations. Citations live on GitHub at [ropenscilabs/ropensci_citations](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ropensci_citations). Here's an example pull request demonstrating how it's done: <https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ropensci_citations/pull/1>. If you just want to look at the citations, peruse [the tsv file](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ropensci_citations/blob/master/citations.tsv).

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following two packagess were recently submitted:

* [MtreeRing][] > A Shiny Application for Automatic Measurements of Tree-Ring Widths on Digital Images
    * Author: [Jingning Shi](https://github.com/JingningShi)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#287](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/287)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned
* [grainchanger][] > Moving-Window and Direct Data Aggregation
    * Author: [Laura Jane Graham](https://github.com/laurajanegraham)

## In The News

We've introduced a template in our **UseCases** category in our discussion forum to make it easy to share how folks are using rOpenSci tools. Check out a recent one by Sharla Gelfand [#visdat, #skimr, and #assertr use case: Exploring and understanding a new data set](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/visdat-skimr-and-assertr-use-case-exploring-and-understanding-a-new-data-set/1620) to find top 5 causes for delays on the TTC subway and SRT in 2018.

[Guangchuang Yu](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/) is writing a bookdown book wrote _Data Integration, Manipulation and Visualization of Phylogenetic Trees_, in which he includes a section of a chapter on the rOpenSci package [treeio](https://yulab-smu.github.io/treedata-book/chapter1.html#getting-tree-data-with-treeio)

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had three recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)

We've got three packages in need of new maintainers:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard SzÃ¶cs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
- [rsnps][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
- [rdpla][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
