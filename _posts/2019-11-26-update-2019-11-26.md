## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package recently went through our software review process and has been approved:

* [baRcodeR][] > Label Creation for Tracking and Collecting Data from Biological Samples
    * Author: [Yihan Wu](https://github.com/yihanwu)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#338](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/338)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Rayna Harris](https://github.com/raynamharris)
        * [LluÃ­s Revilla](https://github.com/llrs)

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintainance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
