## Software Review âœ”

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

Four new use cases were shared in the forum over the past month since our last newsletter:

* Gordon Shotwell: [Using dittodb to test database queries](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-dittodb-to-test-database-queries/2322) - using the rOpenSci package [dittodb][]
* Sharon Machlis: [Shiny apps to search #rstudioglobal or #rstats tweets with rtweet](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/shiny-apps-to-search-rstudioglobal-or-rstats-tweets-with-rtweet/2324), using the [rtweet][] package
* Danielle Navarro: [Use gert to scan all git repos in a directory](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-gert-to-scan-all-git-repos-in-a-directory/2332), using the [gert][] package
* Emilio Bruna: [Mapping collaborations in Neotropical Taxonomy with refsplitr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/mapping-collaborations-in-neotropical-taxonomy-with-refsplitr/2353/1), using the [refsplitr][] package

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [StÃ©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)
