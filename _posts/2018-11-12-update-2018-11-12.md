## rOpenSci HQ 

* OzUnconf <https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/> is running for the third year. The unconference is 22-23 November in Melbourne, Australia. OzUnconf is based on our main unconference in the US (<http://unconf18.ropensci.org/>) but more accessible to folks in Australia/Asia.
* We have an upcoming community call this week on [Working with images in R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/10/24/commcall-nov2018/). Don't miss it!

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
