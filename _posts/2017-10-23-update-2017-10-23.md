## Software Review

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out this short [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## On the blog

We've had two blog posts on our main blog in the past two weeks:

### .rprofile series

Our first post in a series we're calling `.rprofile`: [.rprofile: David Smith](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/13/rprofile-david-smith/) by [Kelly O'Briant](https://kellobri.github.io/). 

Keep an eye out for more posts in this series.

### Onboarding series

In another post in our onboarding series, [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/mpadge) discusses his package `bikedata` and the review process: [Data from Public Bicycle Hire Systems](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/17/bikedata/)
