## Use cases, questions, and answers

* The draft [Fishbase API](https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi) we're working on is being used in a real project! Find it in the `scrapeSpeciesFromFishbase()` function in [ehgoodenough/fishy repo](https://github.com/ehgoodenough/fishy/blob/master/20fish.js).
* [CompadreDB](https://github.com/jonesor/compadreDB) - a database of Plant Matrices for population biology - uses `taxize` to check taxonomic names in their database. See specifically [COMADRE_Check_Taxonomy.R](https://github.com/jonesor/compadreDB/blob/master/Scripts/COMADRE_Check_Taxonomy.R).
* [Francois Michonneau](https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/michonneau.htm) uses `taxize` to make a poster for a conference. [Repo here](https://github.com/fmichonneau/inat-poster).
