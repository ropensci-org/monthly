## Use cases

Three recent papers cite and/or rOpenSci software:

* Rothman et al. have a paper in _Circulation Cardiovascular Interventions_ titled [Pulmonary artery denervation reduces pulmonary artery pressure and induces histological changes in an acute porcine model of pulmonary hypertension][rothman] in which they use and cite the [plotly R client][plotly] [^1]
* McGee et al. have a paper in _Science_ titled [A pharyngeal jaw evolutionary innovation facilitated extinction in Lake Victoria cichlids][mcgee] in which they use and cite [rfishbase][rfishbase] (see the Supplement) [^2]
* Riva et al. have a paper in _Oikos_ titled [Exploring the evolutionary signature of food webs’ backbones using functional traits][riva] in which they use [taxize][taxize], but only evidence in their GitHub repo for the paper, see [gvdr/RDPG_foodweb/blob/master/Code/Ancillary_Code/create_tree.R][rivagithub] [^3]
