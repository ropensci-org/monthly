## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
