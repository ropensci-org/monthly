## In the news

<!-- Make note about ropensci related stuff that happened at useR: from maelle "there were 2 tutorials and 1 talk, as far as I can tell, maybe more, worth checking the program) and start it with a picture of the hex wall asking if people can see the rOpenSci hexes on that wall (rOpenSci logo, and visdat logo, not more I think. The ozunconf `icon` pkg logo is also on the wall" -->

[useR 2018](https://user2018.r-project.org/) happened last week in Brisbane, Australia. 

The hex wall was very cool. See if you can pick out the rOpenSci related stickers (bigger image [here](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/2018-07-11-user-2018-feature-wall_files/final.jpg))
