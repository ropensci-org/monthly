## rOpenSci HQ 

* OzUnconf <https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/> is running for the third year. The unconference is 22-23 November in Melbourne, Australia. OzUnconf is based on our main unconference in the US (<http://unconf18.ropensci.org/>) but more accessible to folks in Australia/Asia.
* We just had a community call. See a recent blog post for all the details: [Community Call - Code Review in the Lab, or ... How do you review code that accompanies a research project?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/10/05/commcall-oct2018/). And here's links to other resources from the call, including recording: <http://communitycalls.ropensci.org/#past-calls>
* We're having another community call coming up soon. See a recent blog post for all the details. [Community Call - Working with images in R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/10/24/commcall-nov2018/).

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following packages were recently submitted:

* [DataSpaceR][] > An R Interface to the CAVD DataSpace
    * Author: [Ju Yeong Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#261](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/261)
   * Reviewers: not assigned yet
* [nlrx][] > Setup, run and analyze NetLogo model simulations from R via XML
    * Author: [Jan Salecker](https://github.com/nldoc)
