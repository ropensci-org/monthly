## rOpenSci HQ

* We welcome package submissions to the rOpenSci suite through a new process. We have always accepted packages, but we now have a more streamlined setup. Go to our [onboarding repository](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/), and follow instructions in the README on how to submit. The process is all GitHub based: submit your package as a new issue in `onboarding`, we assign a reviewer or two, and hold a discussion of the submission in the issue itself. We have more clear [guidelines to follow for creating packages](https://github.com/ropensci/packaging_guide).

## Software

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `geojsonio` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio/). This package helps you convert data.frame's, lists, numeric vectors, and many spatial data classes (from packages `sp`, `rgeos`) to [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html), either as lists, json, or json written to disk. See the [vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio/vignettes/geojsonio_vignette.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio).
* A new package (version `0.1.0`) is on CRAN: `rerdddap` ([http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/)). This package is a general interface for working with ERDDAP servers - basically, many different groups provide data through this open source technology, and this package will let you query and fetch data from any of them. See [here](http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/information.html) for an introduction to ERDDAP. See the [vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/vignettes/rerddap_vignette.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap).
* A new package (version `1.2-0`) `neotoma` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma/). This is an R client to interact with the [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://www.neotomadb.org/). See the [article by the package authors](http://www.openquaternary.com/articles/10.5334/oq.ab/) for information on the Neotoma database, and an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/neotoma).
* A new version (`0.2.6`) of `bold` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/bold). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.2.6) for changes. This is a minor update, focus on fixes to `bold_trace()`. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/bold).
* A new version (`0.4.7`) of `rplos` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.4.7) for changes. This is a minor update, but includes a new function `citations()` to get data from the [PLOS Rich Citations API](http://api.richcitations.org/). [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos).
* A new version (`0.4.0`) of `elastic` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for changes. This is a relatively major update, including the new function `Search_uri()` for when POST requests are blocked on a server (which the `Search()` function uses), an update to `docs_bulk()` to load data directly from a data.frame or list to Elasticsearch via the bulk API. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic).
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `gistr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gistr). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/gistr/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. This is a major update, including: `gist_reate()` can now include source when `knit=TRUE`, new function `gist_create_obj()` posts gists directly from R objects (e.g., data.frame, list), new function `gist_map()` opens a full page map locally from a geojson gist, and new function `tabl()` coerces gist data (including commits) into a data.frame for easy manipulation. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/gistr).
* A new version (`2.0.2`) of `RNeXML` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RNeXML). See [CRAN page NEWS](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RNeXML/NEWS) for changes. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML).
* A new version (`0.10.1`) of `git2r` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/git2r). See the [diff](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/compare/v0.7...v0.10.1) for changes since last version on CRAN. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r).

## Community

* We had our third community call on 2015-04-15, with [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) talking about data ingestion. Watch the vieo [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/125174198). Notes for the call on the [etherpad](https://ropensci.etherpad.mozilla.org/comm-call-04-15) include Hadley's answers to many questions from the audience.
* We added a new person to [our community page](https://ropensci.org/community/#noam), [Noam Ross](http://www.noamross.net/), for serving as a reviewer for [rOpenSci package onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#review-board).

## Use cases, questions, and answers

* We have a new screencast. It is for the `rgbif` package, an R client for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facilty (GBIF)](http://www.gbif.org/). Find the screencast at [http://ropensci.github.io/screencasts/rgbif/](http://ropensci.github.io/screencasts/rgbif/). Let us know if you have any feedback on screencasts. 
* We created two Vimeo channels, one for [community calls](https://vimeo.com/channels/rocommunitycalls), and one for [screencasts](https://vimeo.com/channels/roscreencasts). Now you can subscribe to/follow one or both to get the latest.
