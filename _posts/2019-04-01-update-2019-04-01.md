## rOpenSci HQ

- More than 50 people attended our Community Call on Research Applications of rOpenSci Taxonomy and Biodiversity Tools. Video, slides, and code are available: <https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-03-27/>.  Thank you to our speakers: Kathryn Turner, Zachary Foster, Kari Norman, Margaret Siple, Scott Chamberlain and Ciera Martinez.
- Weâ€™re planning a Community Call on Security for R with Ildi Czeller & Bob Rudis. Create Your Own Security Adventure by [telling us what you want to know about the topic](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/community-call-security-for-r-create-your-own-security-adventure/1612).

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [tidypmc][] > Parse full text XML documents from PMC
    * Author: [Chris Stubben](https://github.com/cstubben)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#290](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/290)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

## In The News

Erik Gahner Larsen and ZoltÃ¡n Fazekas have a bookdown book titled _Quantitative Politics with R_ in which they include _Chapter 4: Get existing data_ with a section on the [European Social Survey](http://qpolr.com/4-datadownload.html#data-european-social-survey-essurvey) using the rOpenSci package [esssurvey][], maintained by Jorge Cimentada.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had five recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)

We've got only one package in need of new maintainers:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard SzÃ¶cs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
