## Software Review

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out this short [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following packages were recently submitted for review:

* [tidyhydat][] > Extract and Tidy Canadian Hydrometric Data
    * Author: [Sam Albers](https://github.com/boshek)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#152](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/152)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet
* [EndoMineR][] > Functions to mine endoscopic and associated pathology datasets
    * Author: [Sebastian Zeki](https://github.com/sebastiz)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#153](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/153)

## On the blog

We've had one blog post on our main blog in the past two weeks:

* [Accessing patent data with the patentsview package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/09/19/patentsview) by [Chris Baker](https://github.com/crew102)

<br><br>



## Use cases

The following four works use/cite rOpenSci or rOpenSci software:

* Olson _et al_. used [taxize][] in their paper [Challenging a bioinformatic tool’s ability to detect microbial contaminants using in silico whole genome sequencing data](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3729) [^1]
* Reznik _et al_. used [taxize][] in their paper [Genome-scale architecture of small molecule regulatory networks and the fundamental trade-off between regulation and enzymatic activity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.08.066) [^2]
*  Cardoso _et al_. used [rgbif][] in their paper [Amazon plant diversity revealed by a taxonomically verified species list](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706756114) [^3]
* Jayasankar cited [rfishbase][] and [rfisheries][] in his paper [Computational options for marine fisheries research and management](http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/12174/1/13-Computational%20options%20for%20marine%20fisheries%20research.pdf) [^4]

If you've used rOpenSci software in a blog post or a paper, tell us on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/share-ropensci-package-citations-plz/515/11) and we'll share it with our community here.
