## Software

### New packages

* A new package `hoardr` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hoardr). `hoardr` is a small package to manage cached files. It uses [rappdirs](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rappdirs/index.html) to get paths that work across platforms. Check out the [hoardr vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hoardr/vignettes/hoardr_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][hoardr]

### Releases

* A new version (`v0.9.8`) of `rgbif` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). This version includes a biggish change in some functions that can accept two kinds of ways to pass in many values for a parameter. In addition, we dropped V8 dependency, replacing it with a WKT toolkit based in C++ [wicket](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/wicket/). This release changes to using `crul` instead of `httr`. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.9.8) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rgbif]
* A new version (`v0.5.4`) of `rbison` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rbison). This release changes to using `crul` instead of `httr`. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rbison/releases/tag/v0.5.4) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rbison]

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

There haven't been any submissions or approved packages since last news - it's a good time to submit your package!  At least ask questions if you're not sure how it works, or if your package is a good fit.


<br><br>

## On the blog

## Use Cases

One blog post and two papers use/cite rOpenSci packages:

* [Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu), one of our onboarding editors, wrote a very nice blog post including use of our packages [scrubr][scrubr] and [spocc][spocc]: [Mapping waxwings annual migration without Twitter](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/04/08/spocc/) [^1]
* Rosenthal _et al_. used our package [taxize][taxize] in their paper [Taxonomic bias in animal behaviour publications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.02.017) [^2]
* Aedo & Pando mentioned [rgbif][rgbif] in their paper [A distribution and taxonomic reference dataset of Geranium in the New World](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.49) [^3]
