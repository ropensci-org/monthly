A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

### main blog

We've had two blog posts on our main blog in the past two weeks.

One of the posts is from our community manager [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/about/#team). In the post [Six tips for running a successful unconference](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/17/unconf-sixtips/) Stefanie writes about six tips for running a succesful unconference.

The other post is a follow up on the recent rOpenSci unconference [ozunconf](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/) in Melbourne, Australia. In the piece [Jonathan Carroll](https://jcarroll.com.au/) summarized one of the projects at the unconf: [2017 rOpenSci ozunconf :: Reflections and the realtime Package](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/14/realtime/)

### technotes

We've had one post on our technotes blog in the past two weeks:

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) discusses `v1` of the [solrium][] package: [solrium 1.0: Working with Solr from R](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2017/11/08/solrium-solr-r/)
