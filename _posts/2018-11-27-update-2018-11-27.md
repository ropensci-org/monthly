## rOpenSci HQ 

* We just had a community call on [Working with images in R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/10/24/commcall-nov2018/). Check out the notes and video at <https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls#past-calls>
* We need a new maintainer for the [chromer][] package! It is a package for interacting with the chromosome counts database (CCDB) <http://ccdb.tau.ac.il>. It is in working order, though there are a number of issues outstanding to address, and other possible issues once you dive in. The package has had two citations (that we know of) so far: [Sessa & Der 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.abr.2016.02.001) and [Zenil-Ferguson et al. 2017](
https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13226).
