## Software

* A new package `geojsonlint` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonlint). `geojsonlint` provides tools for linting 'GeoJSON'. Includes tools for interacting with the online tool <http://geojsonlint.com>, the 'Javascript' library 'geojsonhint' (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojsonhint>), and validating against a GeoJSON schema via our package (<https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonvalidate/>). For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonlint/vignettes/geojsonlint_vignette.html). [Repository on GitHub][geojsonlint].
* A new package `rgeospatialquality` (`v0.3.2`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgeospatialquality). `rgeospatialquality` is a client for the geospatial quality REST API described at <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/02/16/bioinformatics.btw057>. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgeospatialquality/vignettes/geospatial-quality-api.html). [Repository on GitHub][rgeospatialquality].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

We don't have any recent packages that have completed review, but here are a few that are currently undergoing our onboarding process:

* [genbankr][genbankr] > Parsing GenBank files into semantically useful objects
    * Author: [Gabe Becker](https://github.com/gmbecker)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#47](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/47)
    * Reviewer: [David Winter](https://github.com/dwinter)
* [gtfsr][gtfsr] > Working with GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) feeds in R
    * Author: [Danton Noriega](https://github.com/ultinomics)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#55](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/55)
    * Reviewer: [Robin Lovelace](https://github.com/Robinlovelace)
* [ezknitr][ezknitr] > Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr'
    * Author: [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#56](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/56)

## Use cases

One recent paper cites rOpenSci software:

* Olson _et al_. cite [taxize][taxize] in their paper [Foliar nectar enhances plant–mite mutualisms: the effect of leaf sugar on the control of powdery mildew by domatia-inhabiting mites](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw118) [^1]
