## Software

### New packages

* A new package `crminer` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crminer). `crminer` focuses on getting the user full text via the Crossref search API, depending on the full text links provided by publishers in the Crossref search API. See also [rcrossref][rcrossref] Check out the [crminer README](https://github.com/ropensci/crminer#crminer) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][crminer]
* A new package `taxizedb` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxizedb). `taxizedb` is a suite of functions to help users download, load into SQL, and query taxonomic databases. The goal is to make it easy to handle a lot of queries - sometimes making lots of web requests (e.g. with `taxize`) is just too slow. Support thus far for: Integrated Taxonomic Information Service, Catalogue of Life, ThePlantList, and GBIF backbone taxonomy (more to come). This package is likely to have a number of bugs on various platform/database combinations, so please do [report bugs](https://github.com/ropensci/taxizedb/issues). Check out the [taxizedb README](https://github.com/ropensci/taxizedb#taxizedb) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][taxizedb]
* A new package `antiword` (`v1.1`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/antiword). `antiword` wraps the AntiWord utility to extract text from Microsoft Word documents. The utility only supports the old doc format, not the new xml based docx format. Check out the [antiword README](https://github.com/ropensci/antiword#antiword) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][antiword]

### Releases

* A new version (`v0.1.2`) of `binomen` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/binomen). This version includes a fix for new `dplyr` coming out soon. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/binomen/releases/tag/v0.1.2) for details. [Repository on GitHub][binomen]
* A new version (`v0.4.0`) of `rerddap` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap). This version adds a new and very thorough vignette, replaces some internals, changes to using `https` for many URLS in `servers()`, and improves docs. Note that `rerddap` has been archived temporarily but will be back soon - you can always install from GitHub. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rerddap]
* A new version (`v4.6.0`) of `plotly` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/plotly). This version adds significant support for multiple linked views, adds `highlight()` function, support for animation, added support for more `ggplot2` geoms, and much more. See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/blob/master/NEWS.md#460) for details. [Repository on GitHub][plotly]
* A new version (`v1.0.3`) of `EML` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/EML). This version migrates from `XML` to `xml2`, and improves performance for displaying and serializing XML. See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/EML/blob/master/NEWS.md) for details. [Repository on GitHub][EML]
* A new version (`v0.4.0`) of `rebird` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rebird). See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird/blob/master/NEWS.md#rebird-040) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rebird]
* A new version (`v0.2.0`) of `ropenaq` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ropenaq). See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/ropenaq/blob/master/NEWS.md#ropenaq-020) for details. [Repository on GitHub][ropenaq]
* A new version (`v0.7.0`) of `rcrossref` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref). This version breaks off text mining functionality into new package [crminer][crminer]; all Crossref API requests now using `https`; now using `crul` for HTTP requests; many bug fixes. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.7.0) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rcrossref]
* A new version (`v0.5.16`) of `aRxiv` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/aRxiv). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv/releases/tag/0.5.16) for details. [Repository on GitHub][aRxiv]

* A new version (`v0.7.0`) of `rnoaa` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). This version adds new params to `isd()`; new functions for the Climate Prediction Center, and for Africa Rainfall Climatology version 2; many NOAA services now switched to using `https`; many bug fixes. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.7.0) for details. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa]

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
