## rOpenSci HQ

### Fellowships

In a recent blog post, [Announcing the rOpenSci Fellowships Program](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/07/06/ropensci-fellowships), we discussed the rOpenSci fellowship program, designed to support individual researchers and collaborative efforts to help them do better science, build community around projects or best practices, or develop some tools as part of ongoing research that could impact one or more research domains. Check out the post for more information and to apply!

### Postdoc

Stefanie and Karthik wrote a post [Introducing our Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr. Dan Sholler](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/06/30/postdoc_dan_sholler). Dan intends to investigate what drives scientists to engage with or resist open science tools and communities.

## Discussion forum

Recently, on our discussion form <> we've had a few interesting discussions:

* [Peter Meissner asks about maintainer guidelines for R package updates](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/maintainer-guidelines-for-package-updates/772)
* [A conversation linked to our post about our new postdoc Dan Sholler](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/introducing-our-postdoctoral-fellow-dr-dan-sholler/761)

<br><br>

## Software

### New packages

* A new package `rcoreoa` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcoreoa). `rcoreoa` is an R client for the CORE API (<https://core.ac.uk/docs/>). CORE (<https://core.ac.uk>) aggregates open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. Check out the [rcoreoa vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcoreoa/vignettes/cored_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][rcoreoa]
* A new package `taxa` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxa). `taxa` provides taxonomic classes for groupings of taxonomic names both with and without data.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!
