## On the blog

- [Steph Stammel](https://ropensci.org/authors/steph-stammel/) wrote about OzUnconf 2019 ~> [The Fun of Building Things and the Challenge of Learning - the rOpenSci OzUnconf 2019](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/02/05/ozunconf19/). Steph does a really nice job of explaining the motivation behind the unconf and dives into some of the projects explored at the event.

Software Review:

- [Kari Norman](https://ropensci.org/authors/kari-norman/) wrote about her recently rOpenSci reviewed package [taxadb][]: [taxadb: A High-Performance Local Taxonomic Database Interface](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/02/13/taxadb/). Kari discusses the motivation for and design of the package, and how to use taxadb.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

Two use cases have been reported in the forum recently:

* [Mark Padgham](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) shared a use case for his [osmdata][] package: [osmdata use case: Wall Art](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/osmdata-use-case-wall-art/1944)
* [Ivan Leung](https://twitter.com/urganmax) shared a use case for the [pdftools][] package: [pdftools for parsing .pdf from a URL - public data mining](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/pdftools-for-parsing-pdf-from-a-url-public-data-mining/1953)

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
