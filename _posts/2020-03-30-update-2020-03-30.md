## Software Review ‚úî

In the interest of reducing load on reviewers and editors as we manage the COVID-19 crisis, rOpenSci is temporarily pausing new submissions for software peer review. Please check back at our [software review repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) after 17 April for updates. In this period new submissions will not be handled, nor new reviewers assigned. Reviews and responses to reviews will be handled on a 'best effort' basis, but no follow-up reminders will be sent. Other rOpenSci community activities continue. We express our continued great appreciation for the work of our authors and reviewers.

<br><br>

## On the blog

### Tech notes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/author/scott-chamberlain/) wrote a post on the new [parzer][] package: [parzer: Parse Messy Geographic Coordinates](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/03/19/parzer/).

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

The R-Journal is seeking reviewers - checkout [the forum thread](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/request-for-r-journals-reviewers/2007) for more.
 
A new use case was reported in the forum recently:

* Alexei Lutay shared a use case for our pacakge [microdemic][]: [searching Microsoft Academic & extractng the metadata](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/searchng-microsoft-academic-extractng-the-metadata/2012). [microdemic][] is a package for interacting with Microsoft's tool for querying academic literature

<br><br>

## In The News

- `python`: [Python 101: Learning About Lists](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/03/10/python-101-learning-about-lists/)
    - A good introduction to lists in Python; they're kind of like R lists. It's an important data structure to know if you're going to be learning Python
- `testing`: [Necessary & Sufficient](https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2020-02-25-necessary-and-sufficient/)
    - A good read on how to think about testing in general

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.

<br><br>

## Get involved with rOpenSci

We maintain a [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) that can help direct you to the right place, whether you want to make code contributions, non-code contributions, or other things like sharing use cases.
