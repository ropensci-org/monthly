## Software

* Our R binding to the libgit2 library, [git2r](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r), is now on CRAN. Find it at [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/git2r/index.html](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/git2r/index.html). `git2r` is maintained by [Stefan Widgren](https://github.com/stewid). This is a powerful way to work with `git`, allowing you to never have to leave the comfort of the R command line.
* We've started a new package, [elasticdsl](https://github.com/ropensci/elasticdsl), as a higher level client wrapping our Elasticsearch client, [elastic](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic), focused mostly around search (as opposed to cluster management, etc.). With `elasticdsl` you can easily pipe together query statements without having to deal with messy json strings.
* Along the lines of higher level abstractions, we've started playing with a new package, [binomen](https://github.com/ropensci/binomen), that provides tools for manipulating data that includes taxonomic names. It's the same R objects you're used to (data.frame's, lists, etc.), but taxonomically aware (and pipe `%>%` friendly).

## rOpenSci HQ

* We are in the process of defining policy for new packages, which we'll roll out soon. We are also working on a set of guidelines for packages contributed to rOpenSci, which are not strictly enforced, but strongly recommended. We call it the [rOpenSci Packaging Guide](https://github.com/ropensci/packaging_guide). Let us know if you have any feedback on this guide. Soon, we'll be directing current and potential package contributors to these guidelines. 

## Community

* Join us for our second community call. [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv) will demo [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), an R package that makes it easy to create bindings to javascript visualization libraries. Find more details at [ropensci/commcalls#2](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/2). If you have any feedback on community calls, do let us know in the [ropensci/commcalls](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/) repository. 

## Use cases, questions & answers

* There are a lot of GitHub repos using rOpenSci pacakges. We generated a short list of repos using some rOpenSci packages, and posted to our [discussion forum](http://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-of-some-ropensci-packages-on-github/137). If you're curious how our packages are used and in what contexts (teaching, research, etc.), that list is a good place to start.

## API news

* The folks at [OpenContext.org](http://opencontext.org/) - a repository of archaeological data - are working on a new API. We will start work on a new R client for this data [at the upcoming rOpenSci unconf](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues/16).
