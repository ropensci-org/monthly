## rOpenSci HQ

We have a new website! <https://ropensci.org/>

<img src="../assets/img/website.png" width="400">

We've worked hard to create a fresh new site that's easy to navigate, easy to read text,
a more [navigable packages page](https://ropensci.org/packages/), and more.


## Software

### Releases

* A new version (`1.5`) of `pdftools` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pdftools). See the [NEWS](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pdftools/NEWS) for details. Check out the [pdftools README](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools#pdftools) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][pdftools]
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `rdatacite` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rdatacite). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rdatacite/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for details. This version adds new methods for working with the DataCite REST API, different from the functions that work with their Solr service. Check out the [rdatacite README](https://github.com/ropensci/rdatacite#rdatacite) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][rdatacite]
* A new version (`0.7.0`) of `ritis` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ritis). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/ritis/releases/tag/v0.7.0) for details. Check out the [ritis vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ritis/vignettes/ritis_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][ritis]
* A new version (`0.8.0`) of `rplos` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for details. This version switches to using package `solrium` for working with PLOS's Solr service, and swaps out some other dependencies. Check out the [rplos vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos/vignettes/) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][rplos]
* A new version (`2.7`) of `hunspell` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/releases/tag/v2.7) for details.

* A new version (`1.5`) of `magick` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/magick). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/magick/releases/tag/v1.5) for details.

IMPORTANT: this release includes breaking changes - thus the major version bump. This version includes a complete reworking of the way that you set connection details for a Solr instance - making it easy to manage and work with >1 Solr instance within the same R session. You can work with methods on the Solr connection object (an R6 class object) or pass the connection object into a function.

## Software Review

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

## On the blog

### main blog

We've had one blog post on our main blog in the past two weeks:

[Nicholas Tierney ](https://www.njtierney.com/) summarizes the recent <http://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/> unconference in Melbourne, Australia: [Building Communities Together at ozunconf, 2017](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/31/ozunconf2017/)

### technotes

We've had two posts on our technotes blog in the past two weeks:

[Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) and [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/) discuss a neat new feature in the `magick` package: [Image Convolution in R using Magick](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2017/11/02/image-convolve/)

[Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) discussses [Using Magick with RMarkdown and Shiny](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2017/11/07/magick-knitr/)


<br><br>



## Use cases

The following seven works use/cite rOpenSci or rOpenSci software:

* Cardoso cited [rredlist][] in his paper [red - an R package to facilitate species red list assessments according to the IUCN criteria](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e20530) [^1]
* Lee _et al_. cited [rentrez][] in their paper [Using the 'rentrez' R Package to Identify Repository Records for NCBI LinkOut](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/12792) [^2]
* Bakker _et al_. cited and used [rplos][] in their paper [Restriction of opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom in pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework](https://psyarxiv.com/g8cjq/download?format=pdf#page=105) [^3]

If you've used rOpenSci software in a blog post or a paper, tell us on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/share-ropensci-package-citations-plz/515/11) and we'll share it with our community here.
