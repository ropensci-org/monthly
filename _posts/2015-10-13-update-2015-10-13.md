## Software

* A new version (`0.1.4`) of `internetarchive` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/internetarchive/). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/internetarchive/blob/master/NEWS) for changes.
* A new version (`0.6.6`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize/). This version introduces a new function `iucn_id()` to get an IUCN ID from a taxon name. All uBIO functions are now defunct - that is, gone; no longer available in the package. A whole bunch of minor fixes and improvements. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.6.6) for changes.
* A new version (`0.1.4`) of `fulltext` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fulltext/). This version adds a new function `ft_get_si()` to fetch supplementary files for articles (from [Will Pearse](https://github.com/willpearse)). Another new function `ft_links()` helps you grab links for the full text versions of articles (where available). Also included are some bug fixes and minor improvements. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/releases/tag/v0.1.4) for changes.
* A new version (`0.4.0`) of `spocc` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc/). This version includes a new function `as.vertnet()` to coerce various inputs to vertnet occurrence data objects. In addition, `occ()`, the major workhorse in `spocc` gains two new functions, `page` and `start`, to facilitate paging across data sources, regardless of the paging parameters/scheme they use. Also included are some bug fixes and minor improvements. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for changes.
* A new version (`0.8.9`) of `rgbif` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif/). This version includes a number of minor changes and bug fixes, including a fix to the `elevation()` function to make sure checks are done on incoming data (thanks [luisDVA](https://github.com/luisDVA)). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.8.9) for changes.
* A new version (`0.3.4`) of `gistr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gistr/). This version adds a new function `gist_create_git()` to use git via the rOpenSci client `git2r` instead of the GitHub HTTP API. The git interface allows you easily include any arifacts during `knit()`, and to push binary files (e.g., images). Also, improvments and bug fixes. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/gistr/releases/tag/v0.3.4) for changes.
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `rerddap` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/). This version makes the suite of cache functions easier to use by acting not only on cached file names, but the outputs of the main data acquisition functions so you can easily delete cached files as needed. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes.

## Community 

* We had our 7th community call on October 7th with [Tony Fischetti](http://www.onthelambda.com/) talking about [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr). [Notes from the call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvJmMCw-TFsq70r6Qb19SVbhr24PsbrSV5zHdRLz7Cc/edit) and [the video](https://vimeo.com/141906295) are now up.
* Out [8th community call](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/8) is tenatively planned for Wednesday December 2nd, but no speaker planned yet. 

## Use cases

A recent paper cites rOpenSci software:

* Gomez et al. have a paper titled [COMADRE: a global database of animal demography][comadre] in which they cite [taxize][taxize] [^1]

In our discussion forum we maintain a list of uses of our software found in GitHub repos (combination of occassional manual search and via http://scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu): https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-of-some-ropensci-packages-on-github/137. This is a good place to look if you're interested in using, or already use, one of our packages, and want to know how others use it. Here's a smattering of cool examples:

* [rt][rt] - R tools for the command line (uses [git2r][git2r])
* [ratlantis][ratlantis] - R code for interfacing with [Atlantis ecosystem modeling software][atlantis] (uses [rglobi][rglobi], [rfishbase][rfishbase], [rgbif][rgbif], [spocc][spocc], and [taxize][taxize])
* [gissr][gissr] - R functions which make working with spatial data easier (uses [geojsonio][geojsonio])
* [ParticipationInComputing][ParticipationInComputing] - Explore rate and composition of individuals actively participating in the online statistical computing community. (uses [rcrossref][rcrossref])
