## rOpenSci HQ

### Community Calls

We'll have our next community call on September 13th, on rOpenSci Software Review and Onboarding.

Save the date! <https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/15>

We hope past authors and reviewers will attend, as well as people considering volunteering to review rOpenSci packages or people considering submitting their package for review.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [rperseus][] > Gets texts from the Perseus Digital Library
    * Author: [David Ranzolin](https://github.com/daranzolin)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#145](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/145)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet

The following package recently went through our onboarding process and has been approved!

* [bomrang][] > Fetch Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology Data
    * Author: [Adam Sparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#121](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/121)
    * Reviewers:
