## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

## On the blog

### main blog

[Miles McBain](https://github.com/milesmcbain) was kind enough to cross-post a reflection on the value of software peer review from his personal blog: [Where is the value in package peer review?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/04/06/peer-review-value/).

As part of our series of posts on packages that have gone through [rOpenSci onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/) [Konstantinos Vantas](https://kvantas.github.io/) wrote a post ([·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ + œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄ·ø∂ = water + observe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/04/03/hydroscoper/)) about his package [hydroscoper][] for interacting with the [Greek National Data Bank for Hydrometeorological Information](http://www.hydroscope.gr/).
