### New packages

* A new package `vcr` (`v0.1.0`) is on CRAN. `vcr` records HTTP calls to disk - main use case is caching HTTP requests in test suites. The logic of matching HTTP requests is done with our [webmockr][] package. [vcr][] is a port from Ruby land where the [gem of the same name][vcrruby] been battle tested and ported to many other languages. Check out the in progress [http testing book](https://ropensci.github.io/http-testing-book/) to get started. {{ "vcr" | image_cran }} {{ "vcr" | image_github }}

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following two packages were recently submitted:

* [oec][] > Observatory of Economic Complexity API Wrapper and Utility Program
    * Author: Mauricio Vargas
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#217](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/217)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet
* [infx][] > OpenBIS API access to the InfectX data repository
    * Author: [Nicolas Bennett](https://github.com/nbenn)
