## Software

We have two new packages on CRAN, both of which went through our review process (see links below).

* A new package (version `0.1.2`) `textreuse` from [Lincoln Mullen][lmullen] is [on CRAN][trcran]. This package is an R client for measuring similarity among documents and detecting passages which have been reused. There's a variety of vignettes, from an [introduction to the package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/textreuse/vignettes/textreuse-introduction.html) to [Minhash and locality-sensitive hashing](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/textreuse/vignettes/textreuse-minhash.html). [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/textreuse). [Link to review][trreview].
* Another new package (first version `0.0.2`) `stplanr` is [on CRAN][stplanr]. Data access and processing tools for transport planning, including origin-destination analysis, route allocation and modelling travel patterns. See [the vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/introducing-stplanr.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr). [Link to review][stplanrreview].

## Documentation

* We are working on more cheat sheets, for `spocc`, `rgbif`, and more. We'll have drafts of these soon, so let us know if you have any feedback on those in the works, or if you want a cheat sheet we don't have yet at [ropensci/cheatsheets](https://github.com/ropensci/cheatsheets).

## rOpenSci in the news

* [gender][gender] (by our community member [Lincoln Mullen][mullen]) was discussed in a blog post by the website Voxxed: [https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/11/how-packages-make-r-complete/](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/11/how-packages-make-r-complete/)

## Use cases

A new R package uses an rOpenSci package:

* [taxize][taxize] is a dependency in a newish R package [MonoPhy][monophy] for exploring monophyly in a taxonomic group, and data for the [monophy tutorial][mtut] are based on a [(pay-walled) paper][mpaper] from the author. 

A few recent papers cite rOpenSci software:

* Brian O'Meara et al. have a paper titled [Evolutionary models for the retention of adult–adult social play in primates: The roles of diet and other factors associated with resource acquisition][omeara] in which they use and cite [taxize][taxize] [^1]
* Dellinger et al. have a paper titled [Niche dynamics of alien species do not differ among sexual and apomictic flowering plants][dellinger] in which they use and cite [rgbif][rgbif] [^2]
