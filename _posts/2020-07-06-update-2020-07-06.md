## Software Review ✔

<br>

**Software review is now accepting submissions again.**

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

No new submissions or approved submissions.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

A few new use cases were shared in the forum over the past two weeks since our last newsletter:

* [Wei Yang Tham](https://twitter.com/wytham88) shared: [Using qualtRics to study the effect of COVID-19 on scientists](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-qualtrics-to-study-the-effect-of-covid-19-on-scientists/2143/); it leveraged the [qualtRics][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Julia Silge](https://ropensci.org/author/julia-silge/)
* [Steffi LaZerte](https://ropensci.org/author/steffi-lazerte/) shared: [Using DataPackageR to create data package Pandemic Papers with Chris Knox](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-datapackager-to-create-data-package-pandemic-papers-with-chris-knox/2131); it leveraged the [DataPackageR][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Greg Finak](https://github.com/gfinak)
* [Augustus Pendleton](https://twitter.com/AugustusPendle1) shared: [Filtering pdfs using RegEx in their body](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/filtering-pdfs-using-regex-in-their-body/2150); it leveraged the [pdftools][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by Jeroen Ooms


<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had nine recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [Stéphane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [rflybase][]: The current maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
