This edition marks the 2-year anniversay of rOpenSci News!  It's hard to believe this thing has been around for two years. Anyway, we hope you enjoy it, and we'll see you in '17. Happy coding!

## Software

### New packages

* A new package `jsonld` (`v1.1`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonld). JSON-LD is a light-weight syntax for expressing linked data. `jsonld` provides bindings to the JavaScript library [jsonld](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js) for converting, expanding and compacting JSON-LD documents. Check out the [README](https://github.com/ropensci/jsonld#jsonld) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][jsonld]
* A new package `natserv` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/natserv). `natserv` is an interface to [NatureServe](http://www.natureserve.org). Includes methods to get data and image metadata, search taxonomic names, and make maps. Check out the [README](https://github.com/ropensci/natserv#natserv) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][natserv]

### Releases

* A new version (`0.9.6`) of `rgbif` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). This version includes a few bug fixes. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.9.6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rgbif].
* A new version (`1.3`) of `tesseract` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tesseract). This version adds an `options` parameter to `tesseract` for setting engine variables, a new function `tesseract_download()`, and support for `ocr()` on [magick][magick] package images. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract/releases/tag/v1.3) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][tesseract].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `originr` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/originr). This version adds a new data source: Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/originr/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][originr].
* A new version (`2.3`) of `hunspell` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). This version updates `libhunspell`. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/releases/tag/v2.3) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `spocc` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc). This version adds two new data sources: Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][spocc].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `mregions` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mregions). This version is a minor change with some new functions and changes to others - following significant changes in the <http://marineregions.org> web services. More fixes and changes are coming. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/mregions/releases/tag/v0.1.4) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][mregions].
* A new version (`0.1.6`) of `internetarchive` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/internetarchive). See [the NEWS](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/internetarchive/news.html) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][internetarchive].
* A new version (`0.8.0`) of `taxize` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize). This version adds a new data source: Open Tree of Life (OTL), and adds support for that data source to `classification()` and `lowest_common()`. `taxzie` is now importing `ritis` for ITIS data. `lowest_common()` in addition to gaining OTL as a data source gains Catalogue of Life as well. New function `synonyms_df()` to combine outputs from `synonyms()` for single data sources. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for the rest of the changes. [Repository on GitHub][taxize].
* A new version (`0.1.6`) of `crul` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/crul). This version adds improved handling of curl options, now optionally uses `fauxpas` for HTTP condition handling (if you have it installed), adds stream and write to disk support, and adds `raise_for_status()` method to responses. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/crul/releases/tag/v0.1.6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][crul].
* A new version (`1.1`) of `graphql` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/graphql). This version updates `libgraphqlparser` to the latest version. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/graphql/releases/tag/v1.1) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][graphql].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

There haven't been any submissions or approved packages since last news - so please do submit your packages!  At least ask questions if you're not sure how it works, or if your package is a good fit.

<br><br>

## Use cases

A blog post and a few papers cite rOpenSci packages:

* Gavin Simpson wrote a great blog post on [Pangaea and R and open palaeo data](http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2016/12/16/pangaea-r-open-palaeo-data/), which included use of `pangaear`, an rOpenSci client for interacting with the <https://www.pangaea.de/> database. Gavin is also an author on the package. [^1]
* Bradie & Leung use and cite [taxize][taxize] in their paper [A quantitative synthesis of the importance of variables used in MaxEnt species distribution models](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12894) [^2]
* Cramer & Verboom use and cite [taxize][taxize] in their paper [Measures of biologically relevant environmental heterogeneity improve prediction of regional plant species richness](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12911) [^3]
* Pfenninger _et al_. cite [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) in their paper [The importance of open data and software: Is energy research lagging behind?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.046) [^4]
