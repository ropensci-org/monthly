## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

No new submissions or approved submissions.

## On the blog

### Software Review

[OJ Watson](https://ropensci.org/authors/oj-watson/) wrote about his recently reviewed package [rdhs][] [Interacting with The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program data](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/29/rdhs/), including the motivation for the package, what the package does, and some lessons from the process.

<img src="../assets/img/rdhs.png" width="300">

The rOpenSci editors wrote changes in our software review: first,  "rOpenSci onboarding" has been changed to "rOpenSci Software Review"; new editors; changes in standards; issue templates to better direct the different types of submissions; and the new bookdown book "rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review". Read the the post: [rOpenSci Software Peer Review: Still Improving](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/02/01/software-review-news/).

rOpenSci is excited to welcome two new editors: [Announcing new software peer review editors: Melina Vidoni and Brooke Anderson](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/31/more_editors/).

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had three recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge) (since our previous newsletter!)

We've got two packages in need of a new maintainer:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard Sz√∂cs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
- [rsnps][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
