## On the blog

### rOpenSci HQ

rOpenSci has a [new code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct)! Make sure to read the blog post [rOpenSci's new Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/14/conduct/), the new text of the code of conduct, which also contains [reporting guidelines](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/#reporting-guidelines).

<br>

### Software Review

[Stin Van Hoey](https://twitter.com/SVanHoey) and [Peter Desmet](https://twitter.com/peterdesmet) wrote about their recently rOpenSci reviewed package [wateRinfo][], for downloading time series data from [Waterinfo.be](https://www.waterinfo.be/). [wateRinfo - Downloading tidal data to understand the behaviour of a migrating eel](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/22/waterinfo-tidal-eel/)

### Australia Unconference

[Nicholas Tierney](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney) wrote about the recent ozunconf held in Brisbane, Australia: [Continuing to Grow Community Together at ozunconf, 2018](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/08/ozunconf18/). Nick does a nice job describing the unconference, some highlights of the projects, and some great pictures of the event. Also, check out [Episode 6 of Credibly Curious](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious/episode-6-oz-unconf), a podcast by Nick and Saskia Freytag, for a discussion of the unconference.

[Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://twitter.com/mitchoharawild) wrote about one ozunconf project called [vitae][] - [vitae: Dynamic CVs with R Markdown](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/10/vitae/). He writes about the motivation for the package, the design of the package, and goes through an example. `vitae` source is [on GitHub](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vitae), and is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vitae/).

## In The News

Maarten Hermans wrote a nice post, [Exploring historical maps and spatial data with R and OpenStreetMap](https://mhermans.net/post/mapping-leuvense-gangen/), using many packages, including our package [osmdata][] maintained by [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/mpadge) _et al_.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintanence due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had two recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci: 

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard SzÃ¶cs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)

## Related News

- The Python programming language is going through a change of leadership. It used to have a BDFL model, a single leader. But the leader has left and now the Python community is deciding what leadership model they want. [Brett Cannon](https://twitter.com/brettsky) has a nice post on the topic: [An update on Python's governance](https://snarky.ca/an-update-on-pythons-governance/).
- The US federal government shutdown is still going. [Bob Rudis](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr) wrote a nice post on [Roll Your Own Federal Government Shutdown-caused SSL Certificate Expiration Monitor in R](https://rud.is/b/2019/01/10/roll-your-own-federal-government-shutdown-caused-ssl-certificate-expiration-monitor-in-r/) in which he shows some very on topic data munging of federal government websites.
- A shout out to a probably lesser know place to share and gain R knowledge: If you haven't heard of [dev.to](https://dev.to/), it's a sort of developer forum for sharing articles and discussing. They have an R tag <https://dev.to/t/r> and an rstats tag <https://dev.to/t/rstats> - the former has more traffic.
- Some rOpenSci community members are running independent local unconferences (inspired by but not affiliated with rOpenSci). The [Uncoast Unconference](http://uuconf.rbind.io/) aims to bring R users and developers together in flyover country and runs April 14-16 in Des Moines, Iowa. Application deadline is 5 February. The [Chicago R Unconference](https://chirunconf.github.io/) runs March 9-10. Application deadline is 16 February.
