## Software Review ‚úî

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

## On the blog

Software Review:

[April Wright](https://ropensci.org/author/april-wright/), [Christian Rom√°n-Palacios](https://ropensci.org/author/cristian-rom%C3%A1n-palacios/), and [Josef Uyeda](https://ropensci.org/author/josef-uyeda/) wrote about their recently rOpenSci reviewed package [treedata.table][]: [The treedata.table Package](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/09/22/treedata.table/). They discuss how the package came about, why you should use the packag and a bit of high level talk on what can be done with the package.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

Four new use cases were shared in the forum over the past two weeks since our last newsletter:

* [Matt Dray](https://twitter.com/mattdray) shared: [A Twitter bot with rtweet, Mapbox and GitHub Actions](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/a-twitter-bot-with-rtweet-mapbox-and-github-actions/2223); the use case employed the [rtweet][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Michael Kearney](https://github.com/mkearney)
* [Emilio Bruna](https://twitter.com/brunalab) shared two use cases employing the [refsplitr][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by Emilio: 
    * [Mapping scientific collaboration about the Anthropoce with refsplitr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/mapping-scientific-collaboration-about-the-anthropoce-with-refsplitr/2215)
    * [Processing Web of Science records with refsplitr to study author gender and geography](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/processing-web-of-science-records-with-refsplitr-to-study-author-gender-and-geography/2216)
* [Markus Skyttner](https://github.com/mskyttner) shared: [Kontarion - a stack extending rocker/ml-verse for Bibliometric analytics](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/kontarion-a-stack-extending-rocker-ml-verse-for-bibliometric-analytics/2214); the use case employed many rOpenSci packages: [oai][], [rentrez][], [fulltext][], [europepmc][], [refsplitr][], [rcrossref][], [citecorp][], and [roadoi][]

<br><br>


## Related News

* One of our software review editors, [Anna Krystalli](https://twitter.com/annakrystalli), was featured in the podcast RSE Stories, in an episoded titled [R for Reproducibility](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/anna-krystalli/).
* The latest epside of the Changelog Podcast was [How open source saved htop](https://changelog.com/podcast/413). It may be of interest to readers of this newsletter as a vignette of how a project transitioned maintainers. The [original htop repository](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/), and [the new one](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop).

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [St√©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

*We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:*

- [monkeylearn][]: The current maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. [Comment on this thread](https://github.com/ropensci/monkeylearn/issues/142) if you're interested.
