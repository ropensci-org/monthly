## rOpenSci HQ

Our own Maëlle Salmon was featured in an [US-RSE Stories podcast](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/maelle-salmon/). The US-RSE is The United States (US) Research Software Engineer Association. This is a great chance to learn more about Maëlle and some of the work she does.

**Community Calls**

Our next Community Call will cover [Statistical Software Peer Review](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues/20). The date is not yet set. See the link for more details.

**Code of Conduct**

Make sure to read our two recent posts on our Code of Conduct: [rOpenSci Code of Conduct Annual Review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/01/07/conduct2021/) and [rOpenSci 2020 Code of Conduct Transparency Report](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/01/07/transparency2020/)

## Software Review ✔

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

Two new use cases were shared in the forum over the past month since our last newsletter:

* Isabella Velásquez shared: [Scraping liked posts on Twitter using rtweet](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/scraping-liked-posts-on-twitter-using-rtweet/2294); the use case employed the [rtweet][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Michael Kearney](https://mikewk.com/)
* Maëlle Salmon shared: [Using av to convert audio files for compatibility with an electronic storyteller](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-av-to-convert-audio-files-for-compatibility-with-an-electronic-storyteller/2281); the use case employed the [av][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/author/jeroen-ooms/)

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [Stéphane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

We've got three packages in need of a new maintainer. The current maintainer of all three packages is looking for new maintainers. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested. If a new maintainer is not found these packages will be archived.

- [traits][]: species trait data from around the web
- [getlandsat][]: download Landsat 8 data
- [originr][]: Fetch species origin data from the web

<br><br>

## Get involved with rOpenSci
