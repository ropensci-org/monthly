## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had three recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)

We've still got two packages in need of new maintainers:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard Szöcs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
- [rsnps][]: The current maintainer would like to hand it over to someone with more expertise in the domain. Please get in touch with [Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
