Two packages by [Dmytro Perepolkin](https://github.com/dmi3kno) use rOpenSci packages:

- [polite][] uses our [robotstxt][] package to help promote responsible web etiquette when web scraping
- [hocr][] uses our [tesseract][] package to do post-processing of [hOCR files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCR) into tidy formats
