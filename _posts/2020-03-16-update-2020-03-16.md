## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [SymbiotaR2][] > Downloading data from Symbiota2 portals into R
    * Author: [Austin Koontz](https://github.com/akoontz11)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#373](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/373)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

## On the blog

[Steffi LaZerte](https://ropensci.org/author/steffi-lazerte/) wrote a post on our next community call: [Community Call - Maintaining an R Package](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/03/04/commcall-mar2020/).

### Tech notes

[Patrick Schratz](https://ropensci.org/author/patrick-schratz/) wrote a post on using Github Actions with the [tic][] package: [Supercharge your GitHub Actions Experience with tic](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/03/13/tic-ghactions/). `tic` works with many continuous integration (CI) services.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

[Emilio Bruna](https://twitter.com/BrunaLab) asked recently: [What is best practice when a dependency is removed from CRAN?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-is-best-practice-when-a-dependency-is-removed-from-cran/1971)

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.

<br><br>

## Get involved with rOpenSci

We maintain a [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) that can help direct you to the right place, whether you want to make code contributions, non-code contributions, or other things like sharing use cases.
