## rOpenSci HQ 

* OzUnconf <https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/> is running for the third year. The unconference is 22-23 November in Melbourne, Australia. OzUnconf is based on our main unconference in the US (<http://unconf18.ropensci.org/>) but more accessible to folks in Australia/Asia.
* The rOpenSci team at [upcoming events](https://ropensci.org/community/#eventlist):
    * Sep 24-25, New York, NY, Karthik Ram, NumFOCUS Project Forum 2018
* A call to anyone making R packages - especially rOpenSci contributors. Help us build capacity of open source software users and developers with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Create an issue label in your repository named `hacktoberfest`, like these <https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aropensci+label%3Ahacktoberfest>. The label will help potential contributors find your issues!
* One of our community members [David Winter](https://github.com/dwinter) is a finalist in the science category of the New Zealand Open Source Awards <https://nzosa.org.nz/finalists2018/>, in part due to his software contributions ([rentrez][], [rotl][]) and involvement in rOpenSci software reviews.

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## On the blog

### Animal Movement series

We're doing a series of posts corresponding to the material for a talk [Maëlle](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) gave at the [Animal Movement Analysis summer school](http://animove.org/animove-2019-evening-keynotes/) in Radolfzell, Germany on September 12th, at the Max Planck Institute of Ornithology. All five posts are out now:

* [Where to go observe birds in Radolfzell? An answer with R and open data](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/14/where-to-bird/)
* [What birds are observed near Radolfzell? Bird occurrence data in R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/21/birds-radolfzell/)
* [What's this bird? Classify old natural history drawings with R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/08/28/birds-ocr/)
* [What are these birds? Complement occurrence data with taxonomy and traits information](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/09/04/birds-taxo-traits/)

At the recent [R in Pharma conference](http://rinpharma.com/program/the-largest-shiny-application-in-the-world-roche-diagnostics-biowarp.html) Sebastian Wolfe of Roche talked about bioWARP, a large Shiny application for their employees - which uses [RSelenium][]. He goes into detail in a recent blog post: <https://zappingseb.github.io/biowarptruck/>.
