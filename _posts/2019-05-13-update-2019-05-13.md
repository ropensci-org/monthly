## rOpenSci HQ

* Video of our [Community Call on Security for R](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-05-07/) is up, along with a long list of resources. Hear from Bob Rudis on Zen and the art of ensuring confidentiality and integrity in analytics workflows and Ildi Czeller on authorization vs authentication explained through signing commits: why you should do it and how the ropsec package helps you do it the right way.
* Our Community Manager Stefanie Butland is speaking at an R-Ladies Seattle meetup Wed May 22nd on the theme of Learning R and Building Community. Other speakers are Malisa Smith, Bioinformatician at University of Washington, and Pamela Moriarty, Data Scientist at Zulily. See <https://ropensci.org/events/> for details.
* The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research is partnering with rOpenSci and the Antarctic Biodiversity Portal in organizing a short course on tools for Southern Ocean spatial analysis and modeling using R. Apply by Friday, June 15th. See <https://github.com/SCAR/EGABIcourse19> for details.

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. 

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
