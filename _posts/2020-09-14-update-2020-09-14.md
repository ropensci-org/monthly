## rOpenSci HQ

Our own community manager Stefanie Butland, and one of our software review editors Brooke Anderson, are remotely speaking at an R-Ladies East Lansing meetup on Thursday, October 22nd: [rOpenSci - open tools for open science](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/events/272642612/). If you'd like to attend, see "Who could join?" on the [R-Ladies East Lansing page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/).

## Software Review âœ”

<br>

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

No new submissions or approved submissions.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

A new use case was shared in the forum over the past two weeks since our last newsletter:

* [Zhanghe Goh](https://twitter.com/zhanghe_goh) shared: [covidpreprints.com using europepmc and rAltmetric](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/covidpreprints-com-using-europepmc-and-raltmetric/2210); the use case employed the [europepmc][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Najko Nahn](https://github.com/njahn82/), and the [rAltmetric][] package, maintained by [Karthik Ram](https://ropensci.org/author/karthik-ram/)

<br><br>


## Related News

- The website [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) recently had a post covering [data version control with Python and DVC](https://realpython.com/python-data-version-control/). The tool [DVC](https://dvc.org/), written in Python, is a command line tool for "machine learning projects", somewhat similar to git - DVC reminds me of the [Dat project](https://dat.foundation/). On the DVC website, there's an article on [using dvc with R](https://dvc.org/blog/r-code-and-reproducible-model-development-with-dvc).

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: now maintained by [Lennert Schepers (VLIZ)](https://github.com/LennertSchepers)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [StÃ©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)
