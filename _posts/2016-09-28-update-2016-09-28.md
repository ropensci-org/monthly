## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following package recently went through our onboarding process and has been approved:

* [ezknitr][] > Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr'
    * Author: [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#56](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/56)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Tiffany Timbers](https://github.com/ttimbers)
        * [Karthik Ram](https://github.com/karthik)

<br><br>

## Use cases

Three recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software:

* Sanyal and Decocq use and cite [rgbif][] in their paper [Adaptive evolution of seed oil content in angiosperms: accounting for the global patterns of seed oils](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-016-0752-7) [^1]
* Antonelli _et al_. cite [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) in their paper [Towards a Self-Updating Platform for Estimating Rates of Speciation and Migration, Ages, and Relationships of Taxa (SUPERSMART)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw066) [^2]
* Springer _et al_. use and cite [paleobioDB][] in their paper [Waking the undead: implications of a soft explosive model for the timing of placental mammal diversification](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.09.017) [^3]
