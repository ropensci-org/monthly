## Software

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `geoaxe` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geoaxe). `geoaxe` makes it easy to split geospatial objects (polygons) into pieces. For an intro to the package see [the vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geoaxe/vignettes/geoaxe_vignette.html). The immediate use case we have is to make it easy to chop up polygons to use in requests for open data on the web when the data provider limits the length of a polygon specification (usually in [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text)). [Repository on GitHub][geoaxe].
* A new version (`1.0.1`) of `rentrez` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rentrez). See the the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez/releases/tag/v1.0.1) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rentrez].
* A new version (`0.5.6`) of `rplos` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos). See the the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.5.6) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rplos].
* A new version (`0.2`) of `rfisheries` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rfisheries). See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/rfisheries/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L4) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rfisheries].
* A new version (`2.4-1`) of `clifro` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/clifro). [Repository on GitHub][clifro].
* A new version (`1.5.0`) of `neotoma` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma). See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/neotoma/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][neotoma].

## Community

* We will have our 9th community call this Wednesday, March 2nd, at 9 am PST with [Dr. Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) talking about her [Google Spreadsheets R API](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). More details at [ropensci/commcalls#9](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9).

## Use cases

One recent book cites rOpenSci software:

* Wegmann, M. et al. cite a number of rOpenSci packages (`rgbif`, `spocc`, `rebird`, `rfishbase`, `rWBclimate`, `rnoaa`) in their book [Remote sensing and GIS for ecologists: using open source software](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rCCUCwAAQBAJ) [^1]
