## Software Review ‚úî

<br>

**Software review is now accepting submissions again.**

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

<br>

No new submissions or approved submissions.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

A few new use cases were shared in the forum over the past two weeks since our last newsletter:

* [Pedro Rocha](https://twitter.com/pedro_drocha) contributed our first use case in Portuguese! [Extraindo tabelas de documentos pdf em R com Tabulizer](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/extraindo-tabelas-de-documentos-pdf-em-r-com-tabulizer/2178); it leveraged the [tabulizer][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Tom Paskhalis](https://github.com/tpaskhalis)
* [Zhi Yang](https://twitter.com/zhiiiyang) shared: [Creating a self-updating GitHub README using rtweet and GitHub Actions](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/creating-a-self-updating-github-readme-using-rtweet-and-github-actions/2181/); the use case employed the [rtweet][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by [Michael Kearney](https://github.com/mkearney)
* [Rayna Harris](https://twitter.com/zhiiiyang) shared: [Spanish and English blogs on how to use rtweet and magick](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/creating-a-self-updating-github-readme-using-rtweet-and-github-actions/2181/); it used the [rtweet][] and [magick][] packages, rOpenSci packages maintained by [Michael Kearney](https://github.com/mkearney) and [Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/author/jeroen-ooms/), respectively


<br><br>


## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had nine recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [St√©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)
