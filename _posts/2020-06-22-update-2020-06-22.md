## Software Review ‚úî

<br>

**Software review is now accepting submissions again.**

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [tidytags][] > Simple Collection and Powerful Analysis of Twitter Data
    * Author: [Bret Willet](https://github.com/bretsw)
    * Issue: [ropensci/software-review#382](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/382)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

Many new use cases were shared in the forum over the past month since our last newsletter:

* [Iv√°n Mauricio Cely Toro](https://twitter.com/Mauricio_Cely) shared: [Create a time-lapse video using av package](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/create-a-time-lapse-video-using-av-package/2117); it leveraged the [av][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by Jeroen Ooms
* Andr√© Ourednik shared: [Scrape an image from DeepZoom with R and magick, recomposing a single image from multiple tiles](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/scrape-an-image-from-deepzoom-with-r-and-magick-recomposing-a-single-image-from-multiple-tiles/2123); it leveraged the [magick][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by Jeroen Ooms
* [Jay Timm](https://twitter.com/JasonTimm13) shared: [US lawmakers on Twitter during a pandemic: some corpus linguistics methods](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/us-lawmakers-on-twitter-during-a-pandemic-some-corpus-linguistics-methods/2124); it leveraged the [rtweet][] package, an rOpenSci package maintained by Michael Kearney
* [Dave Parr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/u/daveparr) shared: [Testing an API wrapper with webmockr and vcr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/testing-an-api-wrapper-with-webmockr-and-vcr/2125); it leveraged the [webmockr][] and [vcr][] rOpenSci packages


<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Check out our guidance for [taking over maintenance of a package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/changing-maintainers.html).

We've had nine recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [St√©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [rflybase][]: The current maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
