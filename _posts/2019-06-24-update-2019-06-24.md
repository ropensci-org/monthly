## rOpenSci HQ

* rOpenSci‚Äôs community is increasingly international and multilingual. While we have operated primarily in English, we now receive submissions of packages from authors whose primary language is not. As we expand our community in this way, we want to learn from the experience of other organizations. How can we manage our peer-review process and open-source projects to be welcoming to non-native English speakers? Share your perspective in the [public discussion](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/community-call-managing-multilingual-communities/1722) and join our [Community Call on Involving Multilingual Communities](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/06/13/commcall-jun2019/) on Friday, June 28th. No RSVP needed.

## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [UCSCXenaTools][] > Download and Explore Datasets from UCSC Xena Data Hubs
    * Author: [Shixiang Wang](https://github.com/ShixiangWang)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#315](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/315)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

The following two packages recently went through our onboarding process and have been approved:

* [gitignore][] > Create useful .gitignore files for your project
    * Author: [Philippe Massicotte](https://github.com/PMassicotte)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#303](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/303)

## On the blog

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/authors/scott-chamberlain/), [Ma√´lle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/authors/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/), and [Noam Ross](https://ropensci.org/authors/noam-ross/) wrote about [Taking over maintenance of a software package](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/06/12/taking-over-maint/). This blog post is about trying to give guidance to software contributors, and to rOpenSci editors, on how to deal with software maintainer changes.

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
