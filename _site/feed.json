Maëlle gave a talk on tips for developing R packages, of which she’s made many. She wrote up a blog post on her talk: <a href=\"http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/\">How to develop good #rstats packages (for open science)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ropensci.org/about/#team\">Carl Boettiger</a> and <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/about/#team\">Scott Chamberlain</a> participated in a codefest/hackathon last week centered around <a href=\"http://kb.phenoscape.org\">Phenoscape</a> - a knowledebase of computable phenotypes for studies of evolution and genetics.

It integrates with crul right now, but will integrate with other HTTP libraries in the future (e.g., curl). In addition, this package will be used to make vcr possible - a package for mocking HTTP requests, mainly for use in test suites (also going to CRAN soon). Check out the webmockr README to get started. Repository on GitHubReleases  A new version (v0.2.0) of hoardr is on CRAN. This version made some minor changes about writing to disk for caching files, and other minor changes. See release notes for details. Check out the vignette to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new version (v0.1.2) of opencage is on CRAN. See release notes for details. Check out the vignette to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new version (v0.4.2) of rerddap is on CRAN. This version adds use of hoardr for caching files and adds a suite of functions for managing cached files. See release notes for details. Check out the two vignettes to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new version (v1.0.4) of lingtypology is on CRAN. See release notes for details. Check out the vignette to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new version (v0.1.2) of crminer is on CRAN.

See also rcrossref Check out the crminer README to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new package taxizedb (v0.1.0) is on CRAN. taxizedb is a suite of functions to help users download, load into SQL, and query taxonomic databases. The goal is to make it easy to handle a lot of queries - sometimes making lots of web requests (e.g. with taxize) is just too slow. Support thus far for: Integrated Taxonomic Information Service, Catalogue of Life, ThePlantList, and GBIF backbone taxonomy (more to come). This package is likely to have a number of bugs on various platform/database combinations, so please do report bugs. Check out the taxizedb README to get started. Repository on GitHub  A new package antiword (v1.1) is on CRAN. antiword wraps the AntiWord utility to extract text from Microsoft Word documents.
