## Software

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `traits` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/traits/). `traits` is an R client to obtain species trait data from many different sources, including [sequence data from NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide), plant trait data from [BETYdb](https://www.betydb.org/), invasive species data from the [Global Invasive Species Database](http://www.issg.org/database/welcome/) and EOL, [Traitbank data from EOL](http://eol.org/info/516), [Coral traits data](http://coraltraits.org), nativity status from [Flora Europaea](http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/FE/fe.html) or [ITIS](http://www.itis.gov/), and bird data from [Birdlife International](http://www.birdlife.org/). See the [vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/traits/vignettes/traits_intro.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/traits).
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for changes.
