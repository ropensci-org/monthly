## rOpenSci HQ

* We've added six new people to our Community page [ropensci.org/community](https://ropensci.org/community#community) - All from new packages contributed via our onboarding/software review process. Welcome Maëlle, Javier, David, Peter, Mark, and Gordon!

## Software

* A new package `eechidna` (`v0.1`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/eechidna). `eechidna` gets data from the 2013 Australian Federal Election (House of Representatives) and the 2011 Australian Census. Includes tools for visualizing and analysing the data. For an introduction to the package see the five vignettes (CRAN link above). [Repository on GitHub][eechidna].
* A new package `gutenbergr` (`v0.1.1`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gutenbergr). `gutenbergr` helps you download and process public domain works from the [Project Gutenberg collection](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

* A new package `opencage` (`v0.1`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/opencage). `opencage` includes tools for accessing the [OpenCage API](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), which provides forward geocoding (from placename to longitude and latitude) and reverse geocoding (from longitude and latitude to placename). For an introduction to the package see [the vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/opencage/vignettes/opencage.html). [Repository on GitHub][opencage].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review,
but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

The following are rOpenSci packages that have recently gone through our onboarding process:

* [gutenbergr][gutenbergr]
    * Author: [David Robinson](https://github.com/dgrtwo)
    * Review: [ropensci/onboarding#41](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/41)
    * Reviewer: [Maëlle Salmon](https://github.com/masalmon)
* [convertr][convertr]
    * Author: [Gordon Shotwell](https://github.com/GShotwell)
    * Review: [ropensci/onboarding#40](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/40)

## Use cases

Two recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software (or reference rOpenSci):

* Butterfield _et al_. cite and use [rgbif][rgbif] (our GBIF R client) in their paper [Prestoration: using species in restoration that will persist now and into the future](https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.12381) [^1]
* Drost _et al_. cite [taxize][taxize] (the taxonomic toolbelt for R) in their paper [Capturing Evolutionary Signatures in Transcriptomes with myTAI](https://doi.org/10.1101/051565) [^2]
