## Software

* A new package `riem` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/riem). `riem` accesses weather data from the Iowa Environment Mesonet. For an introduction to the package see the [introduction vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/riem/vignettes/riem_package.html). [Repository on GitHub][riem].
* A new version (`1.10.0`) of `ecoengine` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecoengine). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/ecoengine/releases/tag/CRAN-version-1.10.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][ecoengine].
* A new version (`0.1.2`) of `stplanr` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stplanr). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/releases/tag/0.1.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][stplanr].
* A new version (`0.2.1`) of `osmplotr` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/osmplotr). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/osmplotr/releases/tag/v0.2.1) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][osmplotr].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following are rOpenSci packages that have recently gone through our onboarding process:

* [riem][riem]
    * Author: [Maëlle Salmon](https://github.com/masalmon)
    * Review: [ropensci/onboarding#39](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/39)
    * Reviewer: [Brooke Anderson](https://github.com/geanders)

## Use cases

Four recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software (or reference rOpenSci):

* Wagner _et al_. cite and use [taxize][taxize] (our taxonomic toolbelt for R) in their paper [Climate seasonality limits leaf carbon assimilation and wood productivity in tropical forests](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2537-2016) [^1]
* Hartgerink _et al_. cite and use [rplos][rplos] in their paper [Distributions of P-values smaller than .05 in psychology: what is going on?](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1935) [^2]
* Pie cites and uses our [AntWeb][antweb] package in their paper [The macroevolution of climatic niches and its role in ant diversification](https://doi.org/10.1111/een.12306) [^3]
* Read _et al_. mention rOpenSci and cite [paleobioDB][paleobiodb] in their paper [geoknife: reproducible web-processing of large gridded datasets](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01880) [^4]
