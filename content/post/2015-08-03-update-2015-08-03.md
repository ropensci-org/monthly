## Community

We've had some interesting questions on our discussion forum recently:

* Data only packages [https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/data-only-packages/203](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/data-only-packages/203)
* Including metadata with data.frame's [https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/embed-metadata-in-r-objects/221](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/embed-metadata-in-r-objects/221)
* Docker and general scientific computing setups [https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/docker-and-general-scientific-computing-set-ups/217](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/docker-and-general-scientific-computing-set-ups/217)

In addition, we recently [added two new features to our discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/new-features-on-this-forum/222): tags and polls.
