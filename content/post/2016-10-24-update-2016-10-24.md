## Software

### New packages

* A new package `sofa` (`v1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/sofa). `sofa` provides an interface to the NoSQL database CouchDB (<http://couchdb.apache.org>). `sofa` targets Couch v2 and greater, but some functionality will work with older Couch versions. Check out the [intro vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/sofa/vignettes/sofa_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][sofa]

### Releases

* A new version (`0.5.4`) of `ritis` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ritis). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/ritis/releases/tag/v0.5.4) for changes. This version includes a single change: ITIS updated some of their API endpoints to use https. Please do upgrade! [Repository on GitHub][ritis].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `rredlist` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rredlist). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rredlist/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. This version adds new methods `rl_history()` and its companion `rl_history_()`. In addition, there's a minor improvement, and an important bug fix that was affecting Windows users. Windows users are especially encouraged to upgrade. [Repository on GitHub][rredlist].
* A new version (`0.6.5`) of `rnoaa` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.6.5) for changes. This version includes a major bug fix in which binary installations introduced the wrong cache path for those functions that used `rappdirs` for determining the cache path. This was introduced recently when the cache path was initialized on package build. This is now fixed. Everyone should upgrade. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!
