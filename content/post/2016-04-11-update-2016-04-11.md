## rOpenSci HQ

* We're still looking for a community manager! Read about the position [on our blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/10/community-manager-position) to find out more. Informal questions and inquiries welcome at `jobs at ropensci org`.
* We had our 3rd annual rOpenSci unconference in San Francisco from 31 March to 1 April. Check out the website [http://unconf16.ropensci.org](http://unconf16.ropensci.org), and the [issue tracker with lots of ideas](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf16/issues), some of which we worked on (you can tell which had discussion/work by looking at the little icon for number of comments in each issue).

## Software

* A new version (`0.3.5`) of `bold` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/bold). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.3.5) for changes. This version fixes a bug in an internal data parser, and adds more tests. [Repository on GitHub][bold].
* A new version (`0.9.3`) of `rgbif` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.9.3) for changes. In this version: Fixed parsing bug in `name_usage()` function; fix to `occ_download()` to parse error correctly when empty body passed from GBIF; code tidying throughout the package;. The big change: `occ_data()` and `occ_search()` gain ability to more flexibly deal with inputs to the `geometry` parameter. Previously, long WKT strings passed to `occ_data()` and `occ_search()` would fail because URIs can only be so long. Another option is to use the download API (see `?downloads`). This version adds the ability to choose what to do with long WKT strings. [Repository on GitHub][rgbif].
* A new version (`1.0.8`) of `rusda` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rusda). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/rusda/blob/master/NEWS.md#rusda-108) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rusda].
* A new version (`0.7.5`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.9.3) for changes. This version has a few fixes: Fixes to `bold` package (see above), a `taxize` dependency, fixes bugs here; fixed bug in `gnr_resolve()` where we indexed to columns improperly; fixed bug in `iucn_summary()` - requires an API key for the Redlist API when passing in a taxon name, so the function gains new parameter `key` and we updated the docs accordingly. [Repository on GitHub][taxize].
* A new version (`0.3`) of `pdftools` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pdftools). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L3) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][pdftools].
* A new version (`0.1.8`) of `geojsonio` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/releases/tag/v0.1.8) for changes. This version fixes a bug in `geojson_write()`, and other minor improvements. [Repository on GitHub][geojsonio].

## Use cases

One recent paper cites rOpenSci software:

* Miya et al. cite and use [rfishbase][rfishbase] (the [Fishbase](http://www.fishbase.org/) R client) in their paper [Evolutionary Origin of the Scombridae (Tunas and Mackerels): Members of a Paleogene Adaptive Radiation with 14 Other Pelagic Fish Families](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073535) (Note: this is a 2013 paper, but we just found it now :)) [^1]
* Amano et al. cite and use [rgbif][rgbif] (the [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/) R client) in their paper [Spatial Gaps in Global Biodiversity Information and the Role of Citizen Science](http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/29/biosci.biw022) [^2]
