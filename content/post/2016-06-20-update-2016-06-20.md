## Software

* A new package `jsonvalidate` (`v1.0.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonvalidate). `jsonvalidate` wraps the Javascript library [is-my-json-valid](https://github.com/mafintosh/is-my-json-valid) using [V8](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/index.html) to do [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) schema validation in R. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonvalidate/vignettes/jsonvalidate.html). [Repository on GitHub][jsonvalidate].
* A new version (`0.3.5`) of `dvn` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dvn). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/dvn/releases/tag/v0.3.5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][dvn].
* A new version (`0.7.8`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize). Note that you now need an API key when using some IUCN functions, see docs and release notes. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.7.8) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][taxize].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following are rOpenSci packages that have recently gone through our onboarding process:

## Use cases

Four recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software (or reference rOpenSci):

* Olson _et al_. cite [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) in their paper [Drivers of emerging infectious disease events as a framework for digital detection](https://doi.org//10.3201/eid2108.141156) [^1]
* Kamvar _et al_. cite [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) in their paper [Developing educational resources for population genetics in R: an open and collaborative approach](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12558) [^2]
* Niedballa _et al_. cite and use our [taxize][taxize] package in their paper [camtrapR: an R package for efficient camera trap data management](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.12600) [^3]
* Wiser _et al_. cite and use our [taxize][taxize] package in their paper [Achievements and challenges in the integration, reuse and synthesis of vegetation plot data](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12419) [^4]
* In a thesis titled [Sklapanje genoma ogulinske špiljske spužvice (eunapius subterraneus) iz podataka dobivenih tehnologijom sekvenciranja nanoporama](http://digre.pmf.unizg.hr/4616/1/Diplomski_Sribar_KV-DF-SJ-LL.pdf), Dora Šribar cites and uses our [taxize][taxize] package
