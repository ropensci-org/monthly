## Software

* We have started to dive into neuroscience. We recently chatted with three neuroinformaticians about open data and R in their field. They directed us towards lots of interesting sources of open data. Our first shot at this field is the [rif package](https://github.com/ropensci/rif) - an R client to search and get data from the [Neuroscience Information Framework](http://neuinfo.org/) web services. We'd love to work with people in neuroscience/neuroinformatics on R clients. 
* Our R client for [Orcid.org](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid) got a reboot and some new functionality. Give it a try and let us know what you think. [Get started](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid#installation). In addition, [Simon Goring](https://downwithtime.wordpress.com/about/) wrote [a blog post](https://downwithtime.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/building-your-network-using-orcid-and-ropensci/) recently about creating a co-author network using `rorcid`
* We started work on an R client for the key-value store [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) by [Coreos](https://coreos.com/), written in [Go](https://golang.org/). [Try it](https://github.com/ropensci/etseed) - let us know what you think.
* [rentrez](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez), our client for the [NCBI's entrez API](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/) got a new release on CRAN. New features include richer records from `entrez_summary` and a set functions to help users [learn about what data is available from NCBI and how to get it](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez#getting-information-about-ncbi-databases). We've started [planning for a 1.0 release of rentrez](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez/milestones/1.0), so add any requests you have for the package.

## Community

* [Jeff Hollister](http://jwhollister.com/) is the new maintainer of the [maptools task view](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools). The `maptools` task view focuses on tools for mapping and visualizing spatial data in R. Thanks Jeff!
* Attendees of our upcoming unconference/hackathon in March have started to generate ideas for the event. Check them out at [https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues), and check out the [event site](http://unconf.ropensci.org/). If you want to join remotely, [instructions are in the README](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf#ropensci-2015-unconference).

## In the news

* We were listed in the [UPenn guide for R](http://guides.library.upenn.edu/R). w00t!
* Our R client for Solr, `solr`, has been added to the [list of Solr clients on the Apache Solr website](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/IntegratingSolr#R). Sweet :)

## Events

__Past events__  
* [Karthik Ram](http://karthik.io/) participated in a workshop at Imperial College's school of Medicine on tools for [graphical resources for modeling infectious diseases in R](https://sites.google.com/site/hackout2/participants). Details on [our events page](http://ropensci.org/community/events.html).

## Use cases, questions & answers

* In case you aren't aware, we have a shiny new discussion forum based on [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) - it's at [http://discuss.ropensci.org/](http://discuss.ropensci.org/). Join us there for questions, discussion of use cases, feature requests, and more.
