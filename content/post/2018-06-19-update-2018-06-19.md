## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

### rOpenSci Unconference

A series of posts recaping our recent [rOpenSci Unconference](http://unconf18.ropensci.org/):

[Stefanie Butland][roteam] wrote a high level overview of the unconference, and included a wrap-up of blog posts about the event by the community: [Exploring, experimenting, and building software and trust at rOpenSci’s unconf18](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/05/unconf18/)

<a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf18-projects/"><img src="../assets/img/2018unconfprojects.jpg" width="300"></a>

Our team wrote a series of four blog posts recapping the projects that happened at the unconference. Also check out [Stefanie's blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/05/unconf18/) for links to other blog posts about the event.
