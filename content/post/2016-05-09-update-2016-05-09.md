## rOpenSci HQ

* We've completely updated all our tutorials at [ropensci.org/tutorials](https://ropensci.org/tutorials) - and we've added many new ones. Keep an eye out as we'll add even more soon.

## Software

* A new package `originr` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/originr). `originr` gets species origin data (whether species is native/invasive) from the following sources on the web: [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org), [Flora Europaea](http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/FE/fe.html), [Global Invasive Species Database](http://www.iucngisd.org/gisds), the [Native Species Resolver](http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/tools/nsr/nsr-ws/), and [Integrated Taxonomic Information Service](http://www.itis.gov/). For an introduction to the package see the [README](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/originr#originr). [Repository on GitHub][originr].
* A new version (`0.3.2`) of `robotstxt` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/robotstxt). The package provides a simple ‘robotstxt’ class and accompanying methods to parse and check ‘robots.txt’ files. Data fields are provided as data frames and vectors. Permissions can be checked by providing path character vectors and optional bot names. See [the vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/robotstxt/vignettes/using_robotstxt.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub][robotstxt].
* A new version (`3.0.0`) of `rotl` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rotl). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rotl/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rotl].
* A new version (`0.1.7`) of `lawn` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/lawn). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/lawn/releases/tag/v0.1.7) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][lawn].
* A new version (`0.5.6`) of `rnoaa` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.5.6) for changes - this version has a bunch of bug fixes, make sure to upgrade. [Repository on GitHub][rnoaa].
* A new version (`1.5.1`) of `neotoma` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma). See [the NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/neotoma/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][neotoma].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `pangaear` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pangaear). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/pangaear/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][pangaear].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following are rOpenSci packages that have recently gone through our onboarding process:

## Use cases

Six recent papers cite and/or use rOpenSci software (or reference rOpenSci):

* Iraola and Naya cite and use [taxize][taxize] (the taxonomic toolbelt for R) in their paper [Wedding higher taxonomic ranks with metabolic signatures coded in prokaryotic genomes](https://doi.org/10.1101/044115) [^1]
* Perez-Riveral et al. cite [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) in general and [RNeXML][rnexml] specifically in their paper [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of git and GitHub](https://doi.org/10.1101/048744) [^2]
* Jacobs et al. cite [rfigshare][rfigshare] and [dvn][dvn] in their paper [Integrating Research Data Management into Geographical Information Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04729) [^3]
