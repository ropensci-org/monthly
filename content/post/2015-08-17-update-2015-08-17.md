## Software

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `fulltext` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fulltext/). This package makes it easier to search for articles, download articles in full text if available, convert pdf format to plain text, and extract text chunks for vizualization/analysis. We are planning to add bits for analysis in future versions. See the [blog post](http://recology.info/2015/08/full-text/) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext).
* A new version (`0.5.2`) of `rplos` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos/). This was a fairly minor version bump with bug fixes. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.5.2) for changes.
* A new version (`0.6.2`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize/). This version includes numerous bug fixes; fixes to comply with changes in `httr` `v1`; general cleanup of `gni_*()` functions; and fixes to support COL's change from numeric taxonomic identifiers to alphanumeric identifiers. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.6.2) for changes.
* A new version (`0.1.4`) of `geojsonio` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonio/). This version includes bug fixes, and adds a new function `map_leaf()` to make maps with the `leaflet` package, and `geojson_read` allows you to optionally get back a spatial class object instead of geojson. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio/releases/tag/v0.1.4) for changes.
* A new version (`0.11`) of `git2r` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/git2r/). See the [NEWS file](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/blob/master/NEWS#L1-L52) for changes.
* A new version (`2.0.1`) of `rfishbase` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rfishbase/).
* A new version (`0.0.2`) of `webchem` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/webchem/).
