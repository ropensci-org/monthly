## Software

* A new package `europepmc` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/europepmc). `europepmc` is an R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service (<https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService>). It gives access to both metadata on life science literature and open access full texts. In addition to bibliographic metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and reference lists. Links between life-science literature and other EBI databases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. For an introduction to the package see the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/europepmc/vignettes/rebi-vignettes.html). [Repository on GitHub][europepmc].
* A new version (`0.5.4`) of `rcrossref` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.5.4) for changes. This release includes only minor changes. [Repository on GitHub][rcrossref].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `rplos` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for changes. This release includes many minor changes and one bug fix. [Repository on GitHub][rplos].
* A new version (`0.6.0`) of `rfishbase` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rfishbase). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/blob/master/NEWS#L30-L37) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rfishbase].
* A new version (`0.7.9`) of `taxize` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/taxize). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.7.9) for changes. This release includes a new vignette, lots of minor improvements, and four bug fixes. [Repository on GitHub][taxize].
* A new version (`0.7.0`) of `elastic` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.7.0) for changes. Take note of changes: this release changes how `connect()` works; `connect()` has a new `es_path` parameter to set a context path, and now does not ping your ES server on execution - but you can ping afterwards with the new function `ping()`. Another new function added, and many minor improvements and a few bug fixes. [Repository on GitHub][elastic].
* A new version (`1.4.3`) of `hunspell` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/releases/tag/v1.4.3) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`1.6.0`) of `neotoma` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma). See [NEWS](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma/NEWS) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][neotoma].
* A new version (`0.2.4`) of `jqr` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jqr). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/jqr/releases/tag/v0.2.4) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][jqr].
* A new version (`1.4.0`) of `RSelenium` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RSelenium). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/releases/tag/v1.4.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][RSelenium].
* A new version (`0.1.8`) of `fulltext` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fulltext). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/releases/tag/v0.1.8) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][fulltext].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new pacakages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process and is undergoing review:

* [plateR][]
    * Author: [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#60](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/60)
    * Reviewer: [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali)

<br><br>

## Use cases
