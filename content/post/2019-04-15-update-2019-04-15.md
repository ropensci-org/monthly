## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had five recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)

We've got only one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [webchem][]: The current maintainer of webchem, [Eduard Szöcs](https://github.com/EDiLD), is looking for a new maintainer. See [issue #155](https://github.com/ropensci/webchem/issues/155). Do ping Eduard in that issue and/or email us at [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)
