## Software

### New packages

* A new package `wicket` (`v0.2.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/wicket). `wicket` is set of utilities to generate bounding boxes from WKT (Well-Known Text) objects and R data types, validate WKT objects and convert object types from the `sp` package into WKT representations. Check out the [wicket vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/wicket/vignettes/Introduction.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][wicket]

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## Use cases

A thesis and a blog post use/cite rOpenSci packages:

* Lucas cites and uses [taxize][] in his Ph.D. thesis [The role of population structure and size in determining bat pathogen richness](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1531925/) [^1]
* In a blog post from 2015, Rebecca Cain uses [rnoaa][] to explore weather data in Michigan: [NCDC API: an R Interface with many NOAA Data Sources](http://spatialecology.weebly.com/r-code--data/34) [^2]
