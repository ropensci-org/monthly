## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [opentripplanner][] > OpenTripPlanner for R
    * Author: [Malcolm Morgan](https://github.com/mem48)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#295](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/295)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

## In The News

[Tuija Sonkkila]() wrote about working with altmetrics data in her post [Everyday altmetrics](https://blogs.aalto.fi/suoritin/2019/04/10/everyday-altmetrics/), and used our package [crevents][] to get [Crossref Event data](https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/index.html) for a [Shiny app](https://ttso.shinyapps.io/aaltoced/).

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina RÃ¼eger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: we've found a maintainer, but we're still finalizing details

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.

## Related News

- [Brett Cannon](https://github.com/brettcannon), a Python Core developer, broke down/explained an XKCD comic about Python. It's not about R, but still an interesting read. And there's probably lots of R users that read XKCD. Find the post at <https://snarky.ca/deconstructing-xkcd-com-1987/>
