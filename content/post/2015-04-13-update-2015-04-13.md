## Community

* We have our third community call coming up this Wednesday (2015-04-15), in which [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) will talk about data ingestion. [More info](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/3).
* If you have any ideas for upcoming community calls, get back to us in the [issues of the community calls repo](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues).
* We added a new person to [our community page](https://ropensci.org/community/#community), [Kyle Hamilton](http://kylehamilton.com/), for his contributions [RStars](https://github.com/ropensci/RStars), and [RCryptsy](https://github.com/ropensci/RCryptsy/). Kyle, who lives in California, had a great idea to help create easy ways to programatically acquire water resource information given the drought in California. Checkout [the discussion](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/water-resource-api-list-and-development/172).
* [Ben Marwick](https://github.com/benmarwick/) had a great idea to make an R client for interacting with the [Open Dat Kit (ODK)](https://opendatakit.org/) and the [ODK Collect application](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/). Checkout [the discussion](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/field-data-collection-workflow/164) and the [wishlist page](https://github.com/ropensci/wishlist/wiki/Open-Data-Kit-Collect-form-generator-package).

## rOpenSci HQ

* We held our 2nd annual [rOpenSci unconference](http://unconf.ropensci.org/) 26-27 March in San Francisco. It was a smashing success. We discussed projects in the [ropensci/unconf repo](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf) if you want to see what was done - projects included discussions as well as making software. We'll soon have a blog post discussing the event, so look out for that.
* We now use `https` instead of `http` for our website ([http://ropensci.org/](http://ropensci.org/)), and our discussion forum ([https://discuss.ropensci.org/](https://discuss.ropensci.org/)). Let us know if you run into any problems due to `https` on either of those sites.

## Use cases, questions, and answers

* We have a new screencast. It is for the `elastic` package, an R client for Elasticsearch. Find the screencast at [https://ropensci.github.io/screencasts/elastic/](https://ropensci.github.io/screencasts/elastic/). Let us know if you have any feedback on screencasts.
