## rOpenSci HQ 

We've rolled out a change on our website to facilitate exploring blog posts by authors. There's a landing page for all authors at <https://ropensci.org/authors/> that lets you easily navigate to posts by each author. In addition, at the bottom of each blog post you'll find a link to more content by each author. On the page for each author (e.g., <https://ropensci.org/authors/kelly-obriant/>) you'll find a link to their website. Huge thanks to [Maëlle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) for all the work on this 🚀

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.
