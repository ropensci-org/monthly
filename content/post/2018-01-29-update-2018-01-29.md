## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following three packages were recently submitted for review:

* [phylotaR][] > Automated phylogenetic sequence cluster identification from GenBank
    * Author: [Dom Bennett](https://github.com/DomBennett)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#187](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/187)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet
* [NLMR][] > Simulating Neutral Landscape Models
    * Author: [Marco Sciaini](https://github.com/marcosci)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#188](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/188)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet
* [jstor][] > Functions and helpers to import metadata and full-texts delivered
    by Data for Research (DfR) by JSTOR
    * Author: [Thomas Klebel](https://github.com/tklebel)

## On the blog

### main blog

A post went up today [Introducing Ma√´lle Salmon, rOpenSci‚Äôs new Research Software Engineer](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/01/29/rse-ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/).

### technotes

We've had two posts by [Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) on our technotes blog in the past two weeks:

[fulltext v1: text-mining scholarly works](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/01/17/fulltext-v1/) - the post discusses this `v1` release of the `fulltext` package for text-mining scholarly works (mostly journal articles). Give the package a try and let us know what you think.

<img src="../assets/img/fulltext.png" width="300">

[nodbi: the NoSQL Database Connector](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/01/25/nodbi/) - the post discusses a package we started a few years back at an rOpenSci Unconference, but has been mostly ignored since then. We're hoping to revive it - try it out!

## Use cases

If you've used rOpenSci software in a blog post or a paper, tell us on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/share-ropensci-package-citations-plz/515/11) and we'll share it with our community here.

The following four works use/cite rOpenSci or rOpenSci software:

* Selvi & Chandrasekaran used [ropenaq][] in their paper [Performance evaluation of mathematical predictive modeling for air quality forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-017-1667-9) [^1]
* Serra-Diaz _et al_. used [rgbif][] in their paper [Big data of tree species distributions: how big and how good?](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40663-017-0120-0) [^2]
* Sinval _et al_. used [skmir][] in their paper [Work Engagement among Rescue Workers: Psychometric Properties of the Portuguese UWES](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02229) [^3]

## In the news

We recently became aware of an R package [fisheryO](https://github.com/ices-tools-prod/fisheryO) for working with ICES Fisheries Overviews data. See [related post](http://ices.dk/news-and-events/news-archive/news/Pages/New-fisheries-overviews-published.aspx). In this package they leverage the rOpenSci package [rnaturalearth][], maintained by [Andy South](https://github.com/AndySouth).
