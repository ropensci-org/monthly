## Software 📦

### New packages

* A new package `codemetar` (`v0.1.4`) is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/codemetar). The Codemeta Project defines a JSON-LD format for describing software metadata, as detailed at <https://codemeta.github.io>.  `codemetar` provides utilities to generate, parse, and modify `codemeta.json` files automatically for R packages, as well as tools and examples for working with `codemeta.json` JSON-LD more generally. Check out the [codemetar vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/codemetar/vignettes/) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][codemetar]
* A new package `fingertipsR` (`v0.1.5`) is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/codemetar) - this isn't the first version of the package on CRAN, but is the first version on CRAN under rOpenSci. Fingertips (<http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/>) contains data for many indicators of public health in England. The underlying data is now more easily accessible by making use of the API. Check out the [fingertipsR vignettes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fingertipsR/vignettes/) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][fingertipsR]

### Releases

* A new version (`v1.0.1`) of `fulltext` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fulltext). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/releases/tag/v1.0.1) for details. Check out the [fulltext manual](https://ropensci.github.io/fulltext-book/) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][fulltext]
* A new version (`v0.2.0`) of `patentsview` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/patentsview). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for details. Check out the [patentsview docs](https://ropensci.github.io/patentsview/index.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][patentsview]

## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
