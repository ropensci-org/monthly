## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package recently went through our software-review process and has been approved:

* [mapscanner][] > Print Maps, Draw on Them, Scan Them Back In
    * Author: [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/mpadge)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#330](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/330)
    * Reviewers:

## On the blog


It's time for another installment of ... [2 Months in 2 Minutes - rOpenSci News, October 2019](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/17/news-oct2019/) - if you want a brief summary of the last 2 months of these newsletters, these blog posts are for you (written by [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/))

<br>

[Kevin Cazelles](https://ropensci.org/authors/kevin-cazelles/) and [Steve Vissault](https://ropensci.org/authors/steve-vissault/) wrote about their recently approved package [rmangal][], an R client for the [Mangal ecological interactions database](https://mangal.io/) - [rmangal: making ecological networks easily accessible](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/21/rmangal/)

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [mregions][]: The current maintainer [Scott Chamberlain](https://github.com/sckott) is looking for a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
