* We updated our packages page again (<http://ropensci.org/packages/>) -this time making it easier to navigate by sorting packages within each section alphabetically, putting deep link headers for each section (e.g,. <http://ropensci.org/packages/#literature>) on the top of the page, and allowing deep linking to each package (e.g., <http://ropensci.org/packages/#taxize>). Thanks to Matt Jones for the suggestions. 
* The `maptools` TaskView is now operational <https://github.com/ropensci/>maptools in the sense that we can now run `make`, and it should work, so we can start populating...I started adding some sections
