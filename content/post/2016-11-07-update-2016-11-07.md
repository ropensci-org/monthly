## Software

### New packages

* A new package `isdparser` (`v0.1`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/isdparser). `isdparser` provides tools for parsing NOAA Integrated Surface Data (ISD) files, described at <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd>. Data includes for example, wind speed and direction, temperature, cloud data, sea level pressure, and more. ISD data comes from ~35,000 stations worldwide, though best coverage is in North America/Europe/Australia. Included are tools for parsing entire files, or individual lines of data. Check out the [intro vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/isdparser/vignettes/isdparser_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][isdparser]
* A new package `tesseract` (`v1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tesseract). `tesseract` provides bindings to the [Tesseract OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), with unicode (UTF-8) support that can recognize over 100 languages out of the box. Check out the [README](https://github.com/ropensci/tesseract#tesseract) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][tesseract]

### Releases

* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `lawn` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/lawn). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/lawn/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. This version is a big change from the previous version. We've updated the package to use `turf.js` `v3.5.2`, which means some functions are now defunct, there's new functions, and parameters have changed in some functions. Breaking changes are never good, but we're simply trying to mirror the `turf.js` API - hopefully they won't make drastic changes too often. [Repository on GitHub][lawn].
* A new version (`0.1.5`) of `stplanr` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stplanr). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/releases/tag/0.1.5) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][stplanr].
* A new version (`1.0.4`) of `rentrez` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rentrez). [Repository on GitHub][rentrez].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `geojsonlint` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geojsonlint). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/geojsonlint/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes, only major change is upgrading to js library `geojsonhint` `v2.0.0-beta2`. [Repository on GitHub][geojsonlint].
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `mapr` is on [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mapr). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/mapr/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. This version by default colors points separately by taxon, adds convex hull support for most plotting methods, and adds metadata to leaflet popups by default. [Repository on GitHub][mapr].

### Package notes

* [rnoaa][] has its first reverse dependency: [countyweather](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/countyweather/index.html)

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review
system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages
here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who
do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)), and the authors of the packages!

The following package recently went through our onboarding process and has been approved:

* [camsRad][] > Client for CAMS Radiation Service
    * Author: [Lukas Lundström](https://github.com/lukas-rokka)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#72](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/72)
