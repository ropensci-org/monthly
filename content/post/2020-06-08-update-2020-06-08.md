## rOpenSci HQ

* rOpenSci, together with many of our community members, put together a guide to help researchers find open data available in R: [When Field or Lab Work is not an Option - Leveraging Open Data Resources for Remote Research](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/05/19/covid-19-open-data/). The blog post has information on a few topical areas, as well as a table of rOpenSci packages for access to research data.

## Software Review ‚úî

<br>

**Software review is now accepting submissions again.**

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following two packages were recently submitted:

* [medrxivr][] > Access MedRxiv Preprint Data
    * Author: [Luke McGuinness](https://github.com/mcguinlu)
    * Issue: [ropensci/software-review#380](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/380)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned
* [coder][] > Deterministic Categorization of Items Based on External Code Data
    * Author: [Erik B√ºlow](https://github.com/eribul)

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

Many new use cases were shared in the forum over the past month since our last newsletter:

* [Isabella Vel√°squez](https://twitter.com/ivelasq3) shared: [Package for downloading shapefiles using piggyback](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/package-for-downloading-shapefiles-using-piggyback/2073); it leveraged [piggyback][], an rOpenSci package maintained by Carl Boettiger
* [Adam Sparks](https://twitter.com/adamhsparks/) shared: [bomrang with a third party package, stationaRy, to get hourly weather data and clifro to plot wind roses](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/bomrang-with-a-third-party-package-stationary-to-get-hourly-weather-data-and-clifro-to-plot-wind-roses/2082); it leveraged [bomrang][] and [clifro][], rOpenSci packages maintained by Adam Sparks and Blake Seers, respectively
* [Edwin Thoen](https://twitter.com/edwin_thoen) shared: [Using {drake} for machine learning](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/using-drake-for-machine-learning/2091); it leveraged [drake][], an rOpenSci package maintained by Will Landau
* [Sam Albers](https://twitter.com/big_bad_sam) shared: [Detecting the Effects of Sustained Glacier Wastage on Streamflow in Variably Glacierized Catchments](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/detecting-the-effects-of-sustained-glacier-wastage-on-streamflow-in-variably-glacierized-catchments-using-tidyhydat/2095); the use case is from a research article ([Detecting the Effects of Sustained Glacier Wastage on Streamflow in Variably Glacierized Catchments](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.00136/full)) that uses [tidyhydat][]


<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had nine recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)
- [rinat][]: now maintained by [St√©phane Guillou](https://stragu.gitlab.io/)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [rflybase][]: The current maintainer is looking for a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
