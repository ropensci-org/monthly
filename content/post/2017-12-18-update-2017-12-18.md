## rOpenSci HQ

[MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon), an editor with our rOpenSci onboarding software review team, represented rOpenSci at a hackathon event in Ghent, Belgium recently. The event (hashtag [#EAB2017]()) was a event centered around doing software things in R with an ecology focus. Find out more about the event at <https://methodsblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/hackathon-challenges/>. MaÃ«lle gave a talk on tips for developing R packages, of which she's made many. She wrote up a blog post on her talk: [How to develop good #rstats packages (for open science)](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/)

[Carl Boettiger](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) and [Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) participated in a codefest/hackathon last week centered around [Phenoscape](http://kb.phenoscape.org) - a knowledebase of computable phenotypes for studies of evolution and genetics. Check out the repo at <https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/>, the [project ideas](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/issues), and [the teams](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/wiki/Subgroups). There's a small but informative set of tweets on the event at the hashtag [#phenohack](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23phenohack). Carl and Scott worked on [NeXML](http://www.nexml.org/)/[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) interoperability with a great team including [Mark Holder](https://twitter.com/mtholder), [Gaurav Vaidya](https://twitter.com/mrvaidya), [Matt Yoder](https://twitter.com/mjyoder), and [Rutger Vos](https://twitter.com/rvosa). There's a in progress implementation for going between NeXML and JSON-LD at [cboettig/nexld](https://github.com/cboettig/nexld).

A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out this short [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## Use cases

If you've used rOpenSci software in a blog post or a paper, tell us on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/share-ropensci-package-citations-plz/515/11) and we'll share it with our community here.

The following three works use/cite rOpenSci or rOpenSci software:

* Ramasubramanian and Albrecht used [stplanr][] in their book chapter [Placemaking: Why Everything Is Local](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68041-5_5) in the book _The Urban Book Series_ [^1]
* Marx _et al_. used [pdftools][] in their white paper [Synthesis Report on Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in Germany](http://bit.ly/2kfB5td) [^2]
* Armstrong _et al_. used [monkeylearn][] in a book [The 2016 Presidential Election: The Causes and Consequences of a Political Earthquake](http://bit.ly/2B8Lilz). We can't link to an open access version but there is [a screenshot](https://cl.ly/oNXR) showing discussion of the use of the package. [^3]
