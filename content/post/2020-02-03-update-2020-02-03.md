## On the blog

Code of Conduct:

- At the beginning of each year the rOpenSci Code of Conduct Committee does a review of the rOpenSci Code of Conduct. The committee wrote about this review [rOpenSci Code of Conduct Annual Review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/01/16/conduct/) and posted a [new version of the Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).
- Our Code of Conduct transparency report is out: [rOpenSci 2019 Code of Conduct Transparency Report](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/01/16/transparency2019/)

Software Review:

- [Richard Bilderbeek](https://ropensci.org/authors/rich%C3%A8l-j.c.-bilderbeek/) wrote about his recently rOpenSci reviewed package [babette][]: [Call BEAST2 for Bayesian evolutionary analysis from R](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/01/28/babette/). Richard discusses the motivation for the package, what the package does, and his experience of rOpenSci review.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

[Maëlle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/authors/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/) asked a good question that's gathering lots of input: [How do you securely share credentials in your team?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/how-do-you-securely-share-credentials-in-your-team/1931)

Three use cases have been reported in the forum recently:

* [Emilio Bruna](https://twitter.com/brunalab) shared a use case for the recently rOpenSci reviewed pacakge [refsplitr][]: [mapping the location of biogeography researchers with refsplitr](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/mapping-the-location-of-biogeography-researchers-with-refsplitr/1924). [refsplitr][] is maintained by Emilio Bruna
* [Jasper Slingsby](https://twitter.com/JasperSlingsby) shared a use case for the rOpenSci pacakges [rnoaa][] and [lawn][]: [Accessing, wrangling and plotting global weather data](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/accessing-wrangling-and-plotting-global-weather-data-for-free/1926)

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
