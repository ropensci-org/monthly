## rOpenSci HQ

* What would **you** like to hear about in an rOpenSci Community Call? We are soliciting your "votes" and new ideas for Community Call topics and speakers. Find out how you can influence us by checking out our new [Community Calls repository](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls).
* One of our next Community Calls will be about testing. Tell us what you want to know about it or who you'd like to hear from by commenting in our new [Community Calls repository](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls/issues/1).
* Help wanted! We encourage rOpenSci package authors to help us help you get more contributors to your package. If you label an issue "help wanted" (no hyphen or emojis), those issues can be found in a [search of the rOpenSci organization](
https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A"help+wanted"+state%3Aopen&type=Issues); and on the rOpenSci GitHub landing page <https://github.com/ropensci> the number of open help wanted issues is highlighted for each package that has them.

## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [taxadb][] > A High-Performance Local Taxonomic Database Interface
    * Author: [Kari Norman](https://github.com/karinorman)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#344](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/344)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Margaret Siple](https://github.com/mcsiple)
        * [Lindsay Platt](https://github.com/lindsayplatt)

<br><br>

## On the blog

There's a new version of the rOpenSci Dev Guide out. The software review editors wrote up a post describing the accumulated changes since v0.2: [rOpenSci Dev Guide 0.3.0: Updates](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/08/dev-guide-update-fall19/). Some highlights:

- Categories of packages we accept have been modified, make sure to read our new [Aims and Scope section](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#aims-and-scope)
- Package documentation has become a lot easier for packages under rOpenSci. Read Jeroen‚Äôs post [Introducing the new rOpenSci docs server](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2019/06/07/ropensci-docs/) and the new section on [Automatic deployment of the documentation website](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#docsropensci).

### Technical notes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/authors/scott-chamberlain/) wrote a post on updates to the [cran checks API](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2019/10/09/cran-checks-api-update/). The API now has a route to get CRAN check results by maintainer, badges for CRAN checks with a number of different scenarios, and gives access to recent (30 day), and older (back to December 2018) checks data.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

* [Matt Dray](https://github.com/matt-dray) filed a use case on [Can {drake} RAP? Promoting {drake} for pipeline management in UK government](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/can-drake-rap-promoting-drake-for-pipeline-management-in-uk-government/1841). The [drake][] package is maintained by [Will Landau](https://github.com/wlandau).

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We've got one package in need of a new maintainer:

- [mregions][]: The current maintainer [Scott Chamberlain](https://github.com/sckott) is looking for a new maintainer. [Email Scott](mailto:myrmecocystus@gmail.com) if you're interested.
