### Community Calls

We'll have our next community call on September 13th, on rOpenSci Software Review and Onboarding. 

Save the date! <https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/15>

We hope past authors and reviewers will attend, as well as people considering volunteering to review rOpenSci packages or people considering submitting their package for review.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

## On the blog

Stefanie Butland, our community manager, wrote a post on where the rOpenSci team will be at various events over the next 5 months: [Chat with the rOpenSci team at upcoming meetings](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/08/11/ropensci-at-meetings).

We have two blog posts wrapping up our series of posts from [#runconf17](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/):

* [Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/), [Andrew MacDonald](http://aammd.info/), [Kara Woo](http://karawoo.com/), [Carl Boettiger](https://ropensci.org/about/#leadership), and [Jeff Hollister](https://jwhollister.com/) wrote a blog post titled [emldown - From machine readable EML metadata to a pretty documentation website](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/08/01/emldown).
* [Noam Ross](https://twitter.com/noamross) wrote [Unconf 2017: The Roads Not Taken](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/08/08/unconfroadsnottaken), a post that covers the ideas generated but not addressed in our [2017 unconference](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/).
