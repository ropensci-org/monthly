## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following packages were recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [iheatmapr][] > Interactive Complex Heatmaps
    * Author: [Alicia Schep](https://github.com/AliciaSchep)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#107](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/107)
    * Reviewers:
        * [Andee Kaplan](https://github.com/andeek)

## Use Cases

Three papers use/cite rOpenSci packages:

* Balao _et al_. used our package [rgbif][rgbif] in their paper [Adaptive sequence evolution is driven by biotic stress in a pair of orchid species (Dactylorhiza) with distinct ecological optima](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14123) [^1]
* Bartomeus _et al_. used our package [taxize][taxize] in their pre-print [On the inconsistency of pollinator species traits for predicting either response to agricultural intensification or functional contribution.](https://doi.org/10.1101/072132) [^2]
* Vogler _et al_. used our package [rAltmetric][rAltmetric] in their paper [Are Altmetrics Effective in Transdisciplinary Research Fields?. In Everything Changes, Everything Stays the Same?](http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/conferences/isi2017/vogler-elisabeth-203/PDF/vogler.pdf) [^3]
