## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

There haven't been any submissions or approved packages since last news - it's a good time to submit your package!  At least ask questions if you're not sure how it works, or if your package is a good fit.

## On the blog

Our own [Jeroen Oooms](https://ropensci.org/about/#staff) came out with a post on his package `mongolite` [Release mongolite 1.0](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/03/10/mongolite) - it's a great interface to the NoSQL database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Jeroen has done a great job on `mongolite`, including [thorough documentation](https://jeroenooms.github.io/mongolite/).

### Onboarding series

We're doing a series of guest blog posts for packages that have gone through our software review process at [ropensci/onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/).

The 3rd post came out last week, and was by [Claudia Vitolo](https://claudiavitolo.com/) on her package `hddtools` - [Discover hydrological data using the hddtools R package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/03/07/hddtools).

2nd: [Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/) on her package `ropenaq` - [ropenaq, a breath of fresh air/R](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/21/ropenaq).

1st: [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan) on his package `plater` - [From a million nested `ifelse`s to the plater package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/06/plater-blog-post).

We'll have more posts in this series coming out soon - keep an eye out.
