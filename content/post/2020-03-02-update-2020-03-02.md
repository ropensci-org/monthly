## Software Review ✔

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [treedata.table][] > A Wrapper For data.table For Fast Manipulation Of Phylogenetic Trees Matched To Data
    * Author: [Josef Uyeda](https://github.com/uyedaj)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#367](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/367)
    * Reviewers: not yet assigned

The following package recently went through our software-review process and has been approved:

* [parzer][] > Parse Coordinates
    * Author: [Scott Chamberlain](https://github.com/sckott)

## On the blog

It's time for another installment of ... [2 Months in 2 Minutes - rOpenSci News, February 2020](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/02/20/news-feb2020/) - if you want a brief summary of the last 2 months of these newsletters, these blog posts are for you (written by [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/))

<br>

[Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://ropensci.org/authors/julia-stewart-lowndes/) cross-posted a blog post on our blog: [rOpenSci's Leadership in #rstats Culture](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/02/21/ropensci-leadership/). In it she reflects on her experience at the 2020 RStudio conference as well as her experience at the [2015 rOpenSci Unconference](https://unconf15.ropensci.org/).

<br>

Software Review:

[Malcom Morgan](https://ropensci.org/authors/malcolm-morgan/) wrote about his recently rOpenSci reviewed package [opentripplanner][]: [opentripplanner: Fast and Easy Multimodal Trip Planning in R with OpenTripPlanner](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/02/25/opentripplanner/). Malcom discusses the design of the package, and how to use opentripplanner.

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

[Peter Desmet](https://ropensci.org/authors/peter-desmet/) asked a good question that many R package maintainers run in to: [What if raw data in package is too large?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-if-raw-data-in-package-is-too-large/1955)

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina Rüeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
