## Software

A number of packages below were updated simply to fix one or both of two issues: `httr` `v1`, recently on CRAN, made some functionality of our packages not work, and CRAN now requires that all non `base` package functions are explicitly imported (e.g., if `setNames()` is used in the package, then we import `stats::setNames()` in the `NAMESPACE` file). Of course there were other changes too in packages updated below, as noted.

* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `spoccutils` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spoccutils/). `spoccutils` is a companion to the `spocc` package. Where `spocc` focuses on getting you species occurrence data, `spoccutils` will focus on visualizing and cleaning data, among other things. This separation makes both sets of functionality to be maintained more easily. See the [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spoccutils/vignettes/spoccutils_vignette.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/spoccutils).
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `spocc` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spocc/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. Of note: 
    * Mapping functions all gone, now in `spoccutils`. 
    * `occ()` gains new parameter `has_coords` (logical) to only retrieve occurrences with lat/long data, or only without that data. 
    * `type` and `rank` parameters dropped from `occ()`. 
    * New functions `as.*()` (e.g., `as.gbif()`) for all data sources, that take an occurrence key and fetch as detailed information as possible on that occurrence. 
    * New data source: [VertNet](http://vertnet.org/s).
    * `occ2df()` now returns more fields.
* A new version (`0.4.2`) of `rnoaa` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rnoaa/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/releases/tag/v0.4.2) for changes. 
* A new patch version (`0.4.2`) of `rentrez` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rentrez/). See the [news](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rentrez/NEWS) for changes.
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `rvertnet` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rvertnet/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. Of note: `searchbyterm()` and `bigsearch()` now allow some parameters to accept multiple values. In addition, internals of `searchbyterm()`, `spatialsearch()`, and `vertsearch()` reworked to internally do paging for you for bigger result sets.
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `rerddap` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rerddap/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. Of note: Added a suite of functions to manage locally cached files. 
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `rplos` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rplos/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for changes.
* A new version (`0.4.8`) of `rbison` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rbison/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rbison/releases/tag/v0.4.8) for changes.  
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `elastic` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/elastic/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/elastic/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for changes.
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `gistr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gistr/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/gistr/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. Of note: new function `gist_save()` to help save files locally; `gist()` now accepts either a full or partial gist URL in addition to a gist ID.
* A new version (`0.8.6`) of `rgbif` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.8.6) for changes. Of note: New suite of functions for working with GBIF's [download API](http://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence#download), all prefixed with `download_` - see `?downloads` for help.
* A new version (`0.2`) of `rebird` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rebird/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird/releases) for changes.
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `rbhl` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rbhl/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rbhl/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. Of note: gained many new functions. 
* A new version (`0.3.4`) of `rcrossref` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.3.4) for changes. Of note: added new function `crosscite()` to work with the [Crossref Citeproc service](http://crosscite.org/citeproc/).
* A new version (`1.3.2`) of `neotoma` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma/). See the [news](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/neotoma/NEWS) for changes.


## Community

* We had our 5th community call on 2015-07-08, in which [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) gave a great talk on [broom](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom). [More info](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/5#issuecomment-122951281). The video recording will be up soon. 

## Use cases

The following is a small sampling of usage examples of our R packages. 

* Tim Poisot _et al._ have a paper in bioRxiv titled [Synthetic datasets and community tools for the rapid testing of ecological hypotheses][tpoisot] that cites our [taxize paper][taxizems].
* Gwiazdowski _et al._ use `taxize` in their paper [The Hemiptera (Insecta) of Canada: Constructing a Reference Library of DNA Barcodes][plosms]. In addition, their workflow can be replicated in R with code and data files provided in supporting files. Nice!
* Pérez-Luque _et al._ used `taxize` to check plant taxonomic names in their paper [Dataset of Phenology of Mediterranean high-mountain meadows flora (Sierra Nevada, Spain)][phytokeys].
* Thormann _et al._ used `rgbif` to collect species occurrence data in their white paper [Predictive characterization of crop wild relatives and landraces](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/41681)
* [Collins _et al._][catfish] used both our `rfishbase` and `rgbif` packages to get species occurrence data on catfishes in their study area Rio Nhamundá. 
* Turner _et al._ used `rgbif` to collect _Centaurea diffusa_ species occurrence data for her paper [Adaptive plasticity and niche expansion in an invasive thistle](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1599/full)
