## rOpenSci HQ

* We're still looking for a community manager! Read about the position [on our blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/10/community-manager-position) to find out more. Informal questions and inquiries welcome at `jobs at ropensci org`.
* We have two new posts since the last biweekly:
    * [rOpenSci geospatial libraries](http://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/17/ropensci-geospatial-stack) - a brief overview of the geospatial libraries in the rOpenSci suite of packages
    * [Onboarding at rOpenSci: A Year in Reviews](http://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review) - a review of our onboarding system for R packages into rOpenSci

## Community

* We've added three new people to our community page:
	* [Julia Gustavsen](http://ropensci.org/community/#julia)
	* [Robin Lovelace](http://ropensci.org/community/#robin)
	* [Kevin Ushey](http://ropensci.org/community/#kevin)

## Software

* A new package `jqr` (`v0.2.0`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jqr). `jqr` is an R interface to [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq) - a JSON processor. `jq` makes it easy to slice and dice JSON really easily; it's a C library, and has a CLI interface that's really handy in combination with `curl` or similar.  `jqr` has a low level interace to `jq` so that you can copy/paste the exact `jq` commands you use on the CLI. In addition, `jqr` has a high level interace that aims to make it easy to construct `jq` commands with R functions. Additionally, we make it easy to build up `jq` commands with pipes - although you don't have to use pipes. `jqr` supports NSE and SE. `jqr` comes bundled with `jq` itself, and works across all platforms. [Repository on GitHub][jqr].
* A new package `datapack` (`v1.0.0`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/datapack). `datapack` is an R package to handle data packages. `datapack` provides an abstraction for collating heterogeneous collections of data objects and metadata into a bundle that can be transported and loaded into a single composite file. See [the vignette for an overview](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/datapack/vignettes/datapack-overview.html). [Repository on GitHub][datapack].
* A new package `hunspell` (currently at `v0.1.2`) is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/hunspell). `hunspell` is a spell checker package. It directly links to the Hunspell C++ library and works on all platforms without installing additional dependencies. Hunspell is the spell checker library used in LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Mac OS X, InDesign, and a few more. Check out [Hunspell: Spell Checker and Text Parser for R](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/hunspell-release/) and [Stemming and Spell Checking in R](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/hunspell-1-2/) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub][hunspell].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `traits` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/traits). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. This version deprecates a number of functions (they're still avail., but will be defunct/gone in the next version), which are going into a new package [originr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/originr) focused on data on where taxa are native/invasive/etc. [Repository on GitHub][traits].
* A new version (`0.1.5`) of `internetarchive` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/internetarchive). See the the [news](https://github.com/ropensci/internetarchive/blob/master/NEWS.md) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][internetarchive].
* A new version (`0.3.4`) of `bold` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/bold). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.3.4) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][bold].
* A new version (`0.3.0`) of `rebird` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rebird). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird/releases/tag/v0.3) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rebird].
