## rOpenSci HQ 

* OzUnconf <https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/> is running for the third year. The unconference is 22-23 November in Melbourne, Australia. OzUnconf is based on our main unconference in the US (<http://unconf18.ropensci.org/>) but more accessible to folks in Australia/Asia. Deadline for nominations is 12 October.
* A call to anyone making R packages - especially rOpenSci contributors. Help us build capacity of open source software users and developers with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Create an issue label in your repository named `hacktoberfest`, like these <https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aropensci+label%3Ahacktoberfest>. The label will help potential contributors find your issues!

## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package recently went through our onboarding process and has been approved!

* [piggyback][] > Managing Larger Data on a GitHub Repository
    * Author: [Carl Boettiger](https://github.com/cboettig)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#220](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/220)

## In the news

In a blog post ["O'Reilly animals in trouble? Conservation status of book covers"](https://masalmon.eu/2018/08/25/oreilly/) [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) used rOpensci packages [taxize][], [rredlist][], and [robotstxt][] to explore the conservation status of animals on O'Reilly publishers book covers (an example book cover: <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/>).

[Chris Nox](https://twitter.com/vizowl), a data editor for [New Zealand Herald](https://twitter.com/nzherald), used [DataPackageR][] to package up data used in news articles.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have started converting some of the data I am using for articles into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> packages and making them available for others (probably just my future self).<br><br>First two packages are occupation definitions <a href="https://t.co/jMd2bjq9lq">https://t.co/jMd2bjq9lq</a> and school rolls <a href="https://t.co/bgI1dbMORx">https://t.co/bgI1dbMORx</a></p>&mdash; Chris Knox (@vizowl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vizowl/status/1042633504696098816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2018</a></blockquote>
