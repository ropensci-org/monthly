Our 14th community call is coming up in March. The topic is __How to ask questions so they get answered! Possibly by yourself!__, with special guests [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc/) and [JD Long](https://twitter.com/cmastication). Check out [community call #14](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/14) for details.

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process and is undergoing review:

* [getCRUCLdata][] > download and Use CRU CL2.0 Climatology Data in R
    * Author: [Adam Sparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#96](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/96)
    * Reviewers: 
        * [Laura DeCicco](https://github.com/ldecicco-usgs)
        * [Ivan Hanigan](https://github.com/ivanhanigan)

<br><br>

## Use Cases

A thesis, three papers, and a book chapter use/cite rOpenSci packages:

* Monya Baker references rOpenSci in her article [Scientific computing: Code alert](https://doi.org/10.1038/nj7638-563a) [^1]
* Mayor _et al_. used our package [brranching][] in their paper [Elevation alters ecosystem properties across temperate treelines globally](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature21027) [^2]
* Eduard Szöcs cited our package [taxize][] in his Ph.D. thesis [Statistical eco (-toxico) logy: improving the utilisation of data for environmental risk assessment](https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&cqlMode=true&query=idn%3D1124465774) [^3]
* Réjou-Méchain _et al_. adapted code from [taxize][] in the manuscript about their software [BIOMASS](https://github.com/cran/BIOMASS) [BIOMASS: An R Package for estimating aboveground biomass and its uncertainty in tropical forests](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.12753) [^4]
* Puschmann & Ausserhofer referenced rOpenSci in their book chapter [Social Data APIs](http://cbpuschmann.net/pubs/social_data_apis.pdf) [^5]
