## rOpenSci HQ

* What would **you** like to hear about in an rOpenSci Community Call? We are soliciting your "votes" and new ideas for Community Call topics and speakers. Find out how you can influence us by checking out our new [Community Calls repository](https://github.com/ropensci-org/community-calls).
* [Recording and notes](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24/) are up from our latest community call on [Reproducible Workflows at Scale with drake](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/08/08/commcall-sep2019/).
* Help wanted! We encourage rOpenSci package authors to help us help you get more contributors to your package. If you label an issue "help wanted" (no hyphen or emojis), those issues can be found in a [search of the rOpenSci organization](
https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A"help+wanted"+state%3Aopen&type=Issues); and on the rOpenSci GitHub landing page <https://github.com/ropensci> the number of open help wanted issues is highlighted for each package that has them.

### Package notes

The staff supported package [etseed][] is now archived on CRAN. It was an R client for the key-value store [etcd](https://etcd.io/). After understanding the etcd product more, we decided it's not something R users are reaching for.

## Software Review ‚úî

We accept community contributed packages via our software review system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted:

* [eia][] > API Wrapper for 'US Energy Information Administration' Open Data
    * Author: [Matthew Leonawicz](https://github.com/leonawicz)

### Technical notes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/authors/scott-chamberlain/) wrote a post on his new package, [citecorp](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/citecorp/): [citecorp: working with open citations](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2019/09/17/citecorp/). `citecorp` brings R user's data from the [OpenCitations Corpus](http://opencitations.net/corpus); check it out if you are looking for citation data for any reason.

## Related News

* In command line news, there's a new shell in town - [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) - that embraces the tabular world we live in. Listen to the [latest Changelog podcast episode on Nushell](https://changelog.com/podcast/363); it's a bit of work to install it right now, but it's got lots of interesting ideas that may be of interest. Another interesting project is a command line tool - [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi) - that leverages pluggable cheatsheet files (and no, R package cheatsheets in pdf format will not work here).
* Many readers are academics, and thus have perhaps deposited data with, or at least heard of, Dryad. We happen to maintain the R client for Dryad, [rdryad][]. Dryad has [just announced](https://blog.datadryad.org/2019/09/24/new-dryad-is-here/) a refresh of their web services, among other things. Change to `rdryad` will be coming soon.
* [Regex crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) is a fun new (to us) way to learn regex through a crossword format; it's good to know regex no matter what programming language(s) you use!

## Call For Contributors

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had six recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.
