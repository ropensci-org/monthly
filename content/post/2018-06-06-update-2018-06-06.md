## Software Review âœ”

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - an open software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight newly onboarded packages here. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer fill out [this short form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/), and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

There's no now approved submissions or new submissions in the past two weeks.

## On the blog

### technotes

[Scott Chamberlain](https://ropensci.org/about#team) wrote two posts in the past few weeks: 

* [taxize: seven years of taxonomy in R
](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/05/23/taxize-seven-years/) - The [taxize][] package has been around for seven years now. This post covers some of the noteable milestones and covers some upcoming changes.

<img src="../assets/img/taxize_contribs.png" width="300">

* [vcr: record and replay HTTP requests
](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/05/25/vcr-http-request-cacahing/): This post marks the first CRAN release of [vcr][], a package that's been in the works for a few years. `vcr` helps you cache HTTP responses in unit tests. Currently works with `crul`, but integrations with [curl][] and [httr][] are in the works.
