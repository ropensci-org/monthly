## Software Review ‚úî

In the interest of reducing load on reviewers and editors as we manage the COVID-19 crisis, rOpenSci is temporarily pausing new submissions for software peer review. Please check back at our [software review repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) after 17 April for updates. In this period new submissions will not be handled, nor new reviewers assigned. Reviews and responses to reviews will be handled on a 'best effort' basis, but no follow-up reminders will be sent. Other rOpenSci community activities continue. We express our continued great appreciation for the work of our authors and reviewers.

<br><br>

## On the blog

There's a new version of the rOpenSci Dev Guide. The software review editors wrote a post describing the accumulated changes since v0.3: [rOpenSci Dev Guide 0.4.0: Updates](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/04/14/devguide-release/). Some highlights:

- field and laboratory reproducibility tools is now an in scope category; see the [Aims and Scope section](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#aims-and-scope)
- new section with [security guidance](https://devguide.ropensci.org/package-development-security-best-practices.html)
- [package documentation section changes](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#documentation)

It's time for another installment of ... [2 Months in 2 Minutes - rOpenSci News, April 2020](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/04/17/news-apr2020/) - if you want a brief summary of the last 2 months of these newsletters, these blog posts are for you (written by [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/authors/stefanie-butland/))

### Software Review

[Matthew Lau](https://ropensci.org/author/m.k.-lau/) wrote a post on their package ([Rclean][]) that recently went through rOpenSci software review: [Automatic Code Cleaning in R with Rclean](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/04/21/rclean/)

### Technical notes

[Matthew Strimas-Mackey](https://ropensci.org/author/matthew-strimas-mackey/) wrote a blog post on [Extracting eBird Data from a Polygon](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/04/16/ebird-polygon/) using the [auk][] package.

[Ma√´lle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/) has a nice blog post about R Markdown and Hugo learnings! [Miscellaneous Wisdom about R Markdown & Hugo Gained from Work on our Website](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2020/04/23/rmd-learnings/)

## From the Forum

We have a [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) (using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)) for the rOpenSci community. It's a really nice way to have conversations on the internet. From time to time we'll highlight recent discussions of interest.

<br>

A few new use cases were shared in the forum recently:

* [Ma√´lle Salmon](https://ropensci.org/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/) shared: [Use of crul's retry sub-routine in an API package](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/use-of-cruls-retry-sub-routine-in-an-api-package/2035); [crul][] is an HTTP client package maintained by rOpenSci.
* [Peter Solymos](https://twitter.com/analythium) shared a use case concerning [magick][], maintained by [Jeroen Ooms](https://ropensci.org/author/jeroen-ooms/) - [Animated generative art with {magick}](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/animated-generative-art-with-magick/2042)

<br><br>

## Call For Maintainers

Part of the mission of rOpenSci is making sustainable software that users can rely on. Some software maintainers need to give up maintenance due to a variety of circumstances. When that happens we try to find new maintainers. Checkout our [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) for why and how to contribute to rOpenSci.

We've had eight recent examples of maintainer transitions within rOpenSci:

- [RSelenium][]: now maintained by [Ju Kim](https://github.com/juyeongkim)
- [chromer][]: now maintained by [Paula Andrea](https://github.com/orchid00)
- [qualtRics][]: now maintained by [Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge)
- [rsnps][]: now maintained by [Julia Gustavsen](https://github.com/jooolia) and [Sina R√ºeger](https://github.com/sinarueeger)
- [rdpla][]: now maintained by [Alyssa Columbus](https://github.com/acolum)
- [webchem][]: now maintained by [Erik Sapper](https://github.com/eriksapper)
- [mregions][]: in process of moving to maintenance by [VLIZ](http://www.vliz.be)
- [rWBclimate][]: now maintained by [Sergio Ibarra-Espinosa](https://github.com/ibarraespinosa) and [Amanda Rehbein](https://github.com/salvatirehbein)

We don't have any packages looking for new maintainers - if you are a maintainer and want to hand over that role to someone else get in touch with us.

<br><br>

## Get involved with rOpenSci

We maintain a [Contributing Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html) that can help direct you to the right place, whether you want to make code contributions, non-code contributions, or other things like sharing use cases.
