## Software

* A new version (`2.0.4`) of `RNeXML` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RNeXML/). See [NEWS](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/blob/master/NEWS#L30-L33) for changes.
* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `ckanr` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ckanr/). This package is an R client for the [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) [API](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/). CKAN is an open source data portal platform. See [the README](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr#ckanr) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr).
* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `wellknown` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/wellknown/). This package converts WKT to GeoJSON and vice versa, including making WKT from R objects like lists and data.frame's. It doesn't depend on GDAL/GEOS, so installation should be easy everywhere. See [our tutorial](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/wellknown_tutorial.html) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/wellknown).
