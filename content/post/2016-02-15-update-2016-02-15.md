## rOpenSci HQ

* We are holding our 3rd annual [rOpenSci unconference](http://unconf16.ropensci.org) 31 March - April 1 in San Francisco.
* We are trying something new: rOpenSci office hours. The first one is this Thursday at 9 am PST. We'll focus not so much on bug fixing your code, but talking about use cases researchers have working with data, either on the web or not, in R. Our goal with these discussions is to identify common problems researchers have, and then later solve those through software. It's open to anyone - join us! More info in our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/ropensci-office-hours/312).

## Software

* A new package (version `0.3.0`) `solrium` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium). See the vignettes for intros to [solr search](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/search.html), [local Solr setup](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/local_setup.html), [document management](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/document_management.html), and [core/collection management](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/solrium/vignettes/cores_collections.html). This is a reboot of the `solr` package, now compliant with Solr v5 and up, and now with functions for managing cores and collections. The package was re-named because of the major changes in the package, and to make use of the package easier to find on the web. [Repository on GitHub][solrium].
* A new package (version `0.1.0`) `rdatacite` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rdatacite). `rdatacite` is an R client for [Datacite](https://www.datacite.org/node). See the [README](https://github.com/ropensci/rdatacite#rdatacite) for an introduction to the package. [Repository on GitHub][rdatacite].
* A new version (`0.9.1`) of `rgbif` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgbif). `rgbif` is an R client for the [GBIF API](http://www.gbif.org/developer/summary). See the the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases/tag/v0.9.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rgbif].
* A new version (`0.5.0`) of `rotl` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rotl). See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rotl/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rotl].
* A new version (`0.2.0`) of `oai` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/oai). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/oai/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][oai].
* A new version (`0.2.2`) of `rorcid` is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rorcid/). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid/releases/tag/v0.2.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rorcid].
* A new version (`0.5.2`) of `rcrossref` is [on CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rcrossref). See the [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/releases/tag/v0.5.2) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][rcrossref].

## Community

* A few members were added to our community page: [Will Pearse](http://ropensci.org/community/#will) and [Stefan Bache](http://ropensci.org/community/#stefan).
* We will have our 9th community call on March 2nd at 9 am PST with [Dr. Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) talking about her [Google Spreadsheets R API](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). More details at [ropensci/commcalls#9](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9).

## Use cases

Two recent papers cite and/or rOpenSci software:

* Dallas has a paper in _Ecography_ titled [helminthR: An R interface to the London Natural History Museum’s Host-Parasite Database][dallas] in which he describes the [helminthR][helminthr] package [^1]
* Colomb and Brembs have a paper in _Peerj Preprints_ titled [PKC in motorneurons underlies self-learning, a form of motor learning in Drosophila][colomb] in which they use and cite [rfigshare][rfigshare] [^2]
