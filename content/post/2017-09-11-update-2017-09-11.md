## rOpenSci HQ

### Community Calls

We'll have our next community call this week on September 13th, on rOpenSci Software Review and Onboarding.

<https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/15>

We hope past authors and reviewers will attend, as well as people considering volunteering to review rOpenSci packages or people considering submitting their package for review.

<br><br>

## Discussion forum

Recently, on our discussion forum <https://discuss.ropensci.org>:

* [What are good resources for someone starting to use BioConductor?](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/what-are-good-resources-for-someone-starting-to-use-bioconductor/860)

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following package was recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [cRegulome][] > Gets texts from the Perseus Digital Library
    * Author: [Mahmoud Shaaban](https://github.com/MahShaaban)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#149](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/149)
    * Reviewers: not assigned yet

## Use Cases

The following 7 works use/cite rOpenSci or rOpenSci software:

* Ben Baumer mentioned rOpenSci in his preprint [A Grammar for Reproducible and Painless Extract-Transform-Load Operations on Medium Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07073.pdf) [^1]
* Leung _et al_. used [taxize][] in their paper [A quantitative-PCR based method to estimate ranavirus viral load following normalisation by reference to an ultraconserved vertebrate target](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.08.016) [^2]
*  Giroldo _et al_. used [brranching][] in their paper [Trait shifts associated with the subshrub life-history strategy in a tropical savanna](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-017-3930-4) [^3]
* Metzger _et al_. used [nneo][] and [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/) (Docker containers for R) in their paper [eddy4R 0.2.0: a DevOps model for community-extensible processing and analysis of eddy-covariance data based on R, Git, Docker, and HDF5](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3189-2017) [^4]
* Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger (of rOpenSci), and Lincoln Mullen mentioned rOpenSci in their preprint [Packaging data analytical work reproducibly using R (and friends)](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3192v1) [^5]
* A recent blog post [Heat maps with Divvy data 2](http://austinwehrwein.com/data-visualization/heatmaps-with-divvy-data/) by [Austin Wehrwein](http://austinwehrwein.com/) uses our [bikedata][] package [^6]
* A [Shiny application](https://fgabriel1891.shinyapps.io/ecologicaleventminer/) called [Ecological Event Miner](https://github.com/fgabriel1891/Ecological_event_miner), by [Gabriel Muñoz](https://github.com/fgabriel1891), mines ecological events from published literature. It uses three rOpenSci packages: [monkeylearn][], [fulltext][], and [taxize][] [^7]
