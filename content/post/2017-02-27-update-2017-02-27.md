## rOpenSci Community Calls

Our 14th community call is coming up in March. The topic is __How to ask questions so they get answered! Possibly by yourself!__, with special guests [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc/) and [JD Long](https://twitter.com/cmastication). Check out [community call #14](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/14) for details.

## Software

### New packages

Check out the [ccafs vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ccafs/vignettes/ccafs_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][ccafs]
* A new package `randgeo` (`v0.1.0`) is [on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/randgeo). `randgeo` generates random points and shapes in GeoJSON and WKT formats for use in examples, teaching, or statistical applications. `randgeo` has no run-time dependencies. Check out the [randgeo vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/randgeo/vignettes/randgeo_vignette.html) to get started. [Repository on GitHub][randgeo]

This version adds two methods for asynchronous HTTP requests: `Async` as a simple interface that treats all URLs the same - and `AsyncVaried` that accepts any HTTP request using `HttpRequest` method for constructing requests. See [release notes](https://github.com/ropensci/crul/releases/tag/v0.3.0) for changes. [Repository on GitHub][crul].

## Onboarding

We accept community contributed packages via our onboarding system - a software review system, sorta like scholarly paper review, but way better. We'll highlight new packages here that have come through this system. A huge thanks to our reviewers, who do a lot of work reviewing (see the [blog post on our review system](https://ropensci.org/blog/2016/03/28/software-review)),
and the authors of the packages!

If you want to be a reviewer we have a new [form](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) you can fill out, and we'll ping you when there's a submission that fits in your area of expertise.

The following packages were recently submitted to our onboarding process:

* [rBBS][] > Imports North American Breeding Bird Survey data
    * Author: [Bob O'Hara](https://github.com/oharar)
    * Issue: [ropensci/onboarding#98](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/98)

## On the blog

We're doing a series of guest blog posts for packages that have gone through our software review process at [ropensci/onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/).

The first in our series was by [Sean Hughes](https://github.com/seaaan) on his package `plater` - [From a million nested `ifelse`s to the plater package](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/06/plater-blog-post).

The second was by [Maëlle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/) on her package `ropenaq` - [ropenaq, a breath of fresh air/R](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/02/21/ropenaq).

We'll have more posts in this series coming out soon - keep an eye out.

## Use Cases

Two papers use/cite rOpenSci packages:

* Shabangu _et al_. used our package [rerddap][] in their paper [Modelling the effects of environmental conditions on the acoustic occurrence and behaviour of Antarctic blue whales](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172705) [^1]
* Bezerra _et al_. used our package [rfishbase][] in their paper [Fish diversity in tidepools: assembling effects of environmental heterogeneity](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0584-3) [^2]
